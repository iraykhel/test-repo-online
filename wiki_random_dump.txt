The SA was Toyota's first new passenger car design (as opposed to updating the AA) after World War II. It was the first in a family of vehicles before the introduction of the Crown. A series of light trucks also shared the chassis and major components of these passenger cars.
All of these vehicles were sold under the Toyopet name.
SA
The SA was Toyota's first true post war design. It differed from all previous Toyota cars by having a 4-cylinder engine (previously a 6-cylinder was used), 4-wheel independent suspension (previously using rigid axles with leaf springs) and a smaller, "ponton" influenced aerodynamic body. The project was driven by Kiichiro Toyoda under the wisdom of his father's (Sakichi Toyoda) words, "Stay ahead of the times" but most of the design work was done by Dr Kazuo Kumabe.
The body was aerodynamic in a style similar to the Volkswagen Beetle. Only a two door sedan was made, making it unsuitable for the taxi market. The doors were hinged at the rear (often called suicide doors). The front window was a single pane of flat glass with a single wiper mounted above the driver. Only right hand drive was offered.
Toyota engineers (including Dr Kumabe) had visited Germany before World War II and had studied the 16-cylinder Auto Union racing car (independent suspension) and Porsche and Volkswagen designs (independent suspension, aerodynamic bodies, backbone chassis, rear-mounted air-cooled engines, economical production cost). Many Japanese companies had ties with Germany during the war years but most partnered with British or American companies after the war and thus used technologies commonly used in Britain or America. But Toyota did not partner with a foreign company, so it was free to use German designs. Many features of the prototype Beetle were subsequently put into the SA, although the Beetle's rear-mounted air-cooled engine feature was not used. Later on, Toyota revisited the economic principles exemplified by the Beetle when designing the Publica and the Corolla.
Dates and production figures
Although permission to begin full production of passenger cars in Japan was not granted until 1949, limited numbers of cars were permitted to be built from 1947, and the Toyota SA was one such car. Design work started at the end of 1945 when the GHQ let it be known that authorised commercial production of vehicles for the general public would be commencing soon. This model was introduced in January 1947, with a prototype (which had been under development for more than a year) being completed at that time.
Production occurred from October 1947 through May 1952 (overlapping with the 1949-introduced SD), with a total of only 215 being built. The first car to be produced by Toyota in the postwar period was the AC, which had first been produced in 1943-1944. Fifty were built for government and military use in 1947, and three more were assembled in 1948. Since only 54 cars were built by Toyota in 1947, this leaves four Model SA production cars to be built at the end of that year, not counting the prototype.
Eighteen SA cars were built in 1948, and from 1949 to 1952, 193 more were built. No breakdown exists between models after 1948; only yearly passenger-car grand totals are extant.
Mechanicals
This model introduced the Type S straight-4 water-cooled engine, conventionally mounted in the front of the car and driving through the rear wheels. Two small grills at the front allowed air for the engine's radiator. Transmission was by a 3-speed manual gearbox and a Hotchkiss drive (previous Toyotas used a torque tube) to a rear-mounted differential. The final drive gear ratio was 7.17:1 .
More unconventional was the use of a backbone chassis and four-wheel independent suspension. A-arm suspension (short upper arm, long lower arm) with coils was used at the front and swing axle suspension with semi-trailing arms, Panhard rods and a transverse semi-elliptical leaf spring was used at the rear.

SB
A light truck using the running gear from the SA but with a ladder chassis and solid axles front and rear, both with semi-elliptical springs. The SB was popular with the general public and also with the American occupation forces, which ordered it in large numbers.
The SB was offered with commercial bodies only but many dealers and owners had sedan bodies made for them. Toyota contracted the Kanto Denki factory to produced a sedan body and wagon on the SB chassis as the SC.
A small number of police cars were made by adding a special body with a canvas top, 4 canvas doors and a fold down front window for the Japanese Police Reserve Force but they were not popular.

Dates and production figures
Produced from 1947.
Mechanicals
The SB used the same engine and gearbox as the SA, a three-speed manual and the 1-litre "S"-series engine, producing 27 PS (20 kW) at 4,000 rpm. This was enough for a top speed of 68 km/h (42 mph). A conventional ladder frame chassis was used with conventional semi-elliptical springs and solid axles front and rear.

SC
The SB light truck was offered with commercial bodies only but many dealers and owners had sedan bodies made for them. Toyota contracted the Kanto Denki factory to produced a 4-door, 4-seat sedan body and wagon on the SB chassis as the SC. However, production of the SA sedan continued and the SC was not put into production. When production of the SA stopped, a revised version of the SC was made as the SD.
Dates and production figures
3 prototypes were built but the SC did not go into production.
Mechanicals
Same as the SB except for independent front suspension.

SD
A 5-seater passenger car using the same chassis and suspension as the SB.
Dates and production figures
Produced from November 1949 to 1951.
Mechanicals
Same as the SB.

SF
An update to the SD. This sold in considerably higher numbers than any of its predecessors, mainly due to increasing demand for taxis.
Dates and production figures
Produced from October 1951 to 1953. 3,653 were built.
Mechanicals
Same as the SD.

SG
An update to the SB, sharing components with the SF.
Dates and production figures
Produced from March 1952 to 1954.
Mechanicals
Same as the SF.

RH
A further update to the SF but with the newly designed 1.5 liter Type R engine. The RHN's body was made by the New Mitsubishi Heavy Industrial Manufacturing Co. and the RHK's body was made by Kanto Auto Works, Ltd.
The BH26 police patrol car sedan was made from the 4-cylinder RH sedan by using the Type B 6-cylinder engine and a longer front end. Similarly, the BH28 ambulance was made by converting the BH26 police sedan into a van body.
The RH was succeeded by the similar 1955 RR Master and the much more modern 1955 RS Crown.
The RH was also known as the Super.
Dates and production figures
Produced from September 1953 to 1955, 5,845 RHs were built.
Mechanicals
Same as the SF except for the new Type R engine.

FHJ
The FHJ was a fire appliance vehicle built based on the RH but with the much larger Type F engine.  This was sold at the same time as the FAJ (based on the heavy duty FA truck), the FCJ (based on the medium duty FC truck) and the FJJ (based on the BJ Jeep).
Mechanicals
Same as the RH except for the Type F engine. The front body was based on the SG light truck, there were no doors and the rear of the body was heavily customised with typical fire appliance accessories (e.g. hoses, axes, ride-on steps, grab bars). In spite of looking like a small truck, the FHJ still used the single rear wheels of the RH passenger car.

FH24
The FH24 was a fire appliance vehicle built based on the RH but with the much larger Type F engine. It was very similar to the earlier FHJ fire appliance.
Mechanicals
Same as the RH except for the Type F engine. The front body was based on the SG light truck, there were no doors and the rear of the body was heavily customised with typical fire appliance accessories (e.g. hoses, axes, ride-on steps, grab bars). In spite of looking like a small truck, the FH24 still used the single rear wheels of the RH passenger car.

Charles Hanson Veeder (October 1, 1796 – 1871) was a Schenectady, New York-born lawyer who founded the small city of Minden, the seat of Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana.
Veeder was the son of Johannes Veeder and the former Eva Toll. He served in the War of 1812, as part of the New York Light Artillery. He was twice married, the second union probably having been in Louisiana. He had several children, at least one son and a daughter who settled in California.
Veeder practiced law in Indiana but relocated to the northwest Louisiana frontier in 1830. In 1835, he purchased the site of the future town of Minden, named by Veeder for a city in Germany. In 1836, Veeder laid out his town and constructed the first building. He attempted unsuccessfully to obtain Claiborne Parish as the seat of government. He sold lots to area settlers, and the town grew quickly.
Veeder was Minden's first merchant, and he obtained both a post office and a school, the latter throughstate appropriation. In 1849, Veeder left Minden as part of the California gold rush. He settled in Bakersfield, the seat of the farming-oriented Kern County. He practiced law in Bakersfield for the remainder of his life.
Ironically, Veeder died the same year in which Webster Parish was created as the seat of government at Minden. Webster Parish is located west of its mother parish of Claiborne.

Sussex is a borough in Sussex County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the borough's population was 2,130, reflecting a decline of 15 (-0.7%) from the 2,145 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn declined by 56 (-2.5%) from the 2,201 counted in the 1990 Census.
Sussex was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on October 14, 1891, as Deckertown, from portions of Wantage. The borough was renamed Sussex on March 2, 1902.
A joint commission of residents of both Sussex and Wantage had recommended that the two communities should be consolidated to form what would be called the Township of Sussex-Wantage, which would operate within the Faulkner Act under the Council-Manager form of government, with a mayor and a six-member township council, and that voters in both municipalities should approve a referendum to be held on November 3, 2009. The committee noted that the two municipalities share common issues, schools, library and community services and that the artificial nature of the octagonal Sussex border often made it hard to distinguish between the two. The efforts at consolidation with surrounding Wantage Township ended in November 2009 after Wantage voters rejected the merger despite support from Sussex borough residents.

Anne of Green Gables (赤毛のアン, Akage no An, Red-haired Anne) is an animated television series, part of Nippon Animation's World Masterpiece Theater. It was adapted from the novel, Anne of Green Gables, by Lucy Maud Montgomery. Produced by Nippon Animation in 1979, it was first broadcast on Fuji TV from January 7, 1979 to December 30, 1979. Fifty episodes were produced in total.
It has been exported to neighbouring Asian countries and also to Europe and Canada (Anna dai capelli rossi in Italian, Anne la maison aux pignons verts in French, Ana de las Tejas Verdes in Spanish, Ana dos Cabelos Ruivos in Portuguese and Anne mit den roten Haaren in German). As with the novels, the animated version of Anne is much beloved in Japan to this day and "DVD memorial BOX set" (Region 2) was released on August 22, 2008 and a new anime series that serves as a prequel to the series, Kon'nichiwa Anne: Before Green Gables, which premiered on April 5, 2009 in Japan.
As of October 2014, the series is airing in North America on TV Japan.



Story
Anne Shirley is a girl raised in an orphanage. She is an imaginative and talkative girl. One day, Anne was accidentally sent to Miss Marilla Cuthbert and Mr. Matthew Cuthbert, who had originally requested a boy. Miss Marilla was surprised at first. After knowing Anne's sad past, she gradually becomes an irreplaceable member of the family of Cuthbert.
Summary
This anime was directed by Isao Takahata. He chose to make this animated version very true to the original source material, although his two previous works (Heidi, Girl of the Alps and 3000 Leagues in Search of Mother) had been adapted and altered.
Hayao Miyazaki did the scene setting and layout. Previously, he had worked on 3000 Leagues in Search of Mother, although he left the production and Nippon Animation after the first 15 episodes. Miyazaki noticed a difference in Takahata's philosophy of animation; Takahata stuck to controlled, realistic acting at the time, similar to his former work. Miyazaki had not intended to do other work with Takahata, but he had also not planned on becoming independent in this season of his work.
Yoshifumi Kondo (近藤喜文) was selected for character design and animation director over Yoichi Kotabe (小田部羊一), who had stopped work with Takahata after 3000 Leagues in Search of Mother of the previous work. Kondo went on to work with Takahata on the films Grave of the Fireflies and Only Yesterday. The voice of Anne was provided by Eiko Yamada, who would become a staple of World Masterpiece Theatre anime, going on to play Lavinia in Princess Sarah and Jo March in Little Women (the latter of which also featured character designs by Kondo).

Academics
As mentioned, Kelvin has four three year graduate professional degree courses
Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA)
Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA)
BSc.IT (Bachelor of Science – Information Technology)
BSc.Animation (Bachelor of Science – Animation)
About Founder
Mr. Gopal Mathur is a founder of the college, who is having more than 26 years of establishing & controlling the companies and professional set-ups. He started with a business of plants Nursery in the year 1983 with a name Krishna Nursery & Agricultural Farms. The business is now spread in large areas and is one of Uttarakhand’s biggest Nursery with some of its sister concerns named Durga Nursery, Krishna Nursery at Ballupur Area and Corporate Landscaping.
The nursery is providing its unique trees and plants to almost all prestigious organizations of Dehradun like IMA, Petroleum University, Max Hospital, Mahant Inderesh Hospital and many others.
Along with this, he is now investing his funds and time in establishing infrastructure and culture of Kelvin Institute. He is supported by his only son, Mr.Ankit Mathur who is holding a prestigious position of Chairman in college. Mr.Ankit is an MBA in Finance & IT from Amity University, Noida. He also holds the chair of Director in his own established IT company, Kalosoft Systems Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
Conflicts & Contradictions
Since the establishment of college in 2012, the college premises, students and staff of Kelvin had witnessed many success, conflicts, contradictions and challenges
Under-19 Events Under-19 Events was the name of open event organized in month of May in year 2013. It was a competition open for all children having age under 19 years. The categories of event were Modeling & Talent, Cricket, football, Athletics, Carom, Chess, LAN Gaming, Quiz Competition, Shot put, Badminton and sketching. The event held on 16,17,18 and 19 May. Although the event was a success in all terms, but due to its vastness and participation of more than 300 children, there were some obvious situations of misunderstanding. One such situation happened during final game of Football. The match was between the Team of KVI FRI and the local area team. Since football is game of passion and excitement, there were some verbal arguments between players of both teams. The matter was getting exaggerated but was wisely controlled by Founder and Chairman of the college. Other games also has some tiny conflicts like losing team in Quiz competition had some disagreement over decision, 100 meters race suffered from issue of conflicting position. These small things are obvious. But the events were success and after 3 days of excitement, the events came to an end with closing ceremony of prize distribution and cultural programs by participants.
Address Problem The college name is listed on Uttarakhand Technical University’s website but shows wrong address. It is because Kelvin initially started on rented building at Indira Nagar so university’s website has that address. The request is already been made for change in address but is still pending due to some internal reasons of the university.
Under-Constructed Buildings Students of academic session 2012-13 were to be shifted to their permanent campus with all required infrastructure & facilities like computer lab, library, classrooms, staff room, internet, canteen. For fresher students of session 2013-14, the campus was sufficient but was lacking a well organized administrative area. So the construction started in full swing in month of August 2013 and by Feb 2014, the administrative area having offices of Chairman, Founder, Reception, Admission Counselor, etc. was completed.
