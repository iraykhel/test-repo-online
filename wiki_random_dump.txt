The SA was Toyota's first new passenger car design (as opposed to updating the AA) after World War II. It was the first in a family of vehicles before the introduction of the Crown. A series of light trucks also shared the chassis and major components of these passenger cars.
All of these vehicles were sold under the Toyopet name.
SA
The SA was Toyota's first true post war design. It differed from all previous Toyota cars by having a 4-cylinder engine (previously a 6-cylinder was used), 4-wheel independent suspension (previously using rigid axles with leaf springs) and a smaller, "ponton" influenced aerodynamic body. The project was driven by Kiichiro Toyoda under the wisdom of his father's (Sakichi Toyoda) words, "Stay ahead of the times" but most of the design work was done by Dr Kazuo Kumabe.
The body was aerodynamic in a style similar to the Volkswagen Beetle. Only a two door sedan was made, making it unsuitable for the taxi market. The doors were hinged at the rear (often called suicide doors). The front window was a single pane of flat glass with a single wiper mounted above the driver. Only right hand drive was offered.
Toyota engineers (including Dr Kumabe) had visited Germany before World War II and had studied the 16-cylinder Auto Union racing car (independent suspension) and Porsche and Volkswagen designs (independent suspension, aerodynamic bodies, backbone chassis, rear-mounted air-cooled engines, economical production cost). Many Japanese companies had ties with Germany during the war years but most partnered with British or American companies after the war and thus used technologies commonly used in Britain or America. But Toyota did not partner with a foreign company, so it was free to use German designs. Many features of the prototype Beetle were subsequently put into the SA, although the Beetle's rear-mounted air-cooled engine feature was not used. Later on, Toyota revisited the economic principles exemplified by the Beetle when designing the Publica and the Corolla.
Dates and production figures
Although permission to begin full production of passenger cars in Japan was not granted until 1949, limited numbers of cars were permitted to be built from 1947, and the Toyota SA was one such car. Design work started at the end of 1945 when the GHQ let it be known that authorised commercial production of vehicles for the general public would be commencing soon. This model was introduced in January 1947, with a prototype (which had been under development for more than a year) being completed at that time.
Production occurred from October 1947 through May 1952 (overlapping with the 1949-introduced SD), with a total of only 215 being built. The first car to be produced by Toyota in the postwar period was the AC, which had first been produced in 1943-1944. Fifty were built for government and military use in 1947, and three more were assembled in 1948. Since only 54 cars were built by Toyota in 1947, this leaves four Model SA production cars to be built at the end of that year, not counting the prototype.
Eighteen SA cars were built in 1948, and from 1949 to 1952, 193 more were built. No breakdown exists between models after 1948; only yearly passenger-car grand totals are extant.
Mechanicals
This model introduced the Type S straight-4 water-cooled engine, conventionally mounted in the front of the car and driving through the rear wheels. Two small grills at the front allowed air for the engine's radiator. Transmission was by a 3-speed manual gearbox and a Hotchkiss drive (previous Toyotas used a torque tube) to a rear-mounted differential. The final drive gear ratio was 7.17:1 .
More unconventional was the use of a backbone chassis and four-wheel independent suspension. A-arm suspension (short upper arm, long lower arm) with coils was used at the front and swing axle suspension with semi-trailing arms, Panhard rods and a transverse semi-elliptical leaf spring was used at the rear.

SB
A light truck using the running gear from the SA but with a ladder chassis and solid axles front and rear, both with semi-elliptical springs. The SB was popular with the general public and also with the American occupation forces, which ordered it in large numbers.
The SB was offered with commercial bodies only but many dealers and owners had sedan bodies made for them. Toyota contracted the Kanto Denki factory to produced a sedan body and wagon on the SB chassis as the SC.
A small number of police cars were made by adding a special body with a canvas top, 4 canvas doors and a fold down front window for the Japanese Police Reserve Force but they were not popular.

Dates and production figures
Produced from 1947.
Mechanicals
The SB used the same engine and gearbox as the SA, a three-speed manual and the 1-litre "S"-series engine, producing 27 PS (20 kW) at 4,000 rpm. This was enough for a top speed of 68 km/h (42 mph). A conventional ladder frame chassis was used with conventional semi-elliptical springs and solid axles front and rear.

SC
The SB light truck was offered with commercial bodies only but many dealers and owners had sedan bodies made for them. Toyota contracted the Kanto Denki factory to produced a 4-door, 4-seat sedan body and wagon on the SB chassis as the SC. However, production of the SA sedan continued and the SC was not put into production. When production of the SA stopped, a revised version of the SC was made as the SD.
Dates and production figures
3 prototypes were built but the SC did not go into production.
Mechanicals
Same as the SB except for independent front suspension.

SD
A 5-seater passenger car using the same chassis and suspension as the SB.
Dates and production figures
Produced from November 1949 to 1951.
Mechanicals
Same as the SB.

SF
An update to the SD. This sold in considerably higher numbers than any of its predecessors, mainly due to increasing demand for taxis.
Dates and production figures
Produced from October 1951 to 1953. 3,653 were built.
Mechanicals
Same as the SD.

SG
An update to the SB, sharing components with the SF.
Dates and production figures
Produced from March 1952 to 1954.
Mechanicals
Same as the SF.

RH
A further update to the SF but with the newly designed 1.5 liter Type R engine. The RHN's body was made by the New Mitsubishi Heavy Industrial Manufacturing Co. and the RHK's body was made by Kanto Auto Works, Ltd.
The BH26 police patrol car sedan was made from the 4-cylinder RH sedan by using the Type B 6-cylinder engine and a longer front end. Similarly, the BH28 ambulance was made by converting the BH26 police sedan into a van body.
The RH was succeeded by the similar 1955 RR Master and the much more modern 1955 RS Crown.
The RH was also known as the Super.
Dates and production figures
Produced from September 1953 to 1955, 5,845 RHs were built.
Mechanicals
Same as the SF except for the new Type R engine.

FHJ
The FHJ was a fire appliance vehicle built based on the RH but with the much larger Type F engine.  This was sold at the same time as the FAJ (based on the heavy duty FA truck), the FCJ (based on the medium duty FC truck) and the FJJ (based on the BJ Jeep).
Mechanicals
Same as the RH except for the Type F engine. The front body was based on the SG light truck, there were no doors and the rear of the body was heavily customised with typical fire appliance accessories (e.g. hoses, axes, ride-on steps, grab bars). In spite of looking like a small truck, the FHJ still used the single rear wheels of the RH passenger car.

FH24
The FH24 was a fire appliance vehicle built based on the RH but with the much larger Type F engine. It was very similar to the earlier FHJ fire appliance.
Mechanicals
Same as the RH except for the Type F engine. The front body was based on the SG light truck, there were no doors and the rear of the body was heavily customised with typical fire appliance accessories (e.g. hoses, axes, ride-on steps, grab bars). In spite of looking like a small truck, the FH24 still used the single rear wheels of the RH passenger car.

Charles Hanson Veeder (October 1, 1796 – 1871) was a Schenectady, New York-born lawyer who founded the small city of Minden, the seat of Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana.
Veeder was the son of Johannes Veeder and the former Eva Toll. He served in the War of 1812, as part of the New York Light Artillery. He was twice married, the second union probably having been in Louisiana. He had several children, at least one son and a daughter who settled in California.
Veeder practiced law in Indiana but relocated to the northwest Louisiana frontier in 1830. In 1835, he purchased the site of the future town of Minden, named by Veeder for a city in Germany. In 1836, Veeder laid out his town and constructed the first building. He attempted unsuccessfully to obtain Claiborne Parish as the seat of government. He sold lots to area settlers, and the town grew quickly.
Veeder was Minden's first merchant, and he obtained both a post office and a school, the latter throughstate appropriation. In 1849, Veeder left Minden as part of the California gold rush. He settled in Bakersfield, the seat of the farming-oriented Kern County. He practiced law in Bakersfield for the remainder of his life.
Ironically, Veeder died the same year in which Webster Parish was created as the seat of government at Minden. Webster Parish is located west of its mother parish of Claiborne.

Sussex is a borough in Sussex County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the borough's population was 2,130, reflecting a decline of 15 (-0.7%) from the 2,145 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn declined by 56 (-2.5%) from the 2,201 counted in the 1990 Census.
Sussex was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on October 14, 1891, as Deckertown, from portions of Wantage. The borough was renamed Sussex on March 2, 1902.
A joint commission of residents of both Sussex and Wantage had recommended that the two communities should be consolidated to form what would be called the Township of Sussex-Wantage, which would operate within the Faulkner Act under the Council-Manager form of government, with a mayor and a six-member township council, and that voters in both municipalities should approve a referendum to be held on November 3, 2009. The committee noted that the two municipalities share common issues, schools, library and community services and that the artificial nature of the octagonal Sussex border often made it hard to distinguish between the two. The efforts at consolidation with surrounding Wantage Township ended in November 2009 after Wantage voters rejected the merger despite support from Sussex borough residents.

Anne of Green Gables (赤毛のアン, Akage no An, Red-haired Anne) is an animated television series, part of Nippon Animation's World Masterpiece Theater. It was adapted from the novel, Anne of Green Gables, by Lucy Maud Montgomery. Produced by Nippon Animation in 1979, it was first broadcast on Fuji TV from January 7, 1979 to December 30, 1979. Fifty episodes were produced in total.
It has been exported to neighbouring Asian countries and also to Europe and Canada (Anna dai capelli rossi in Italian, Anne la maison aux pignons verts in French, Ana de las Tejas Verdes in Spanish, Ana dos Cabelos Ruivos in Portuguese and Anne mit den roten Haaren in German). As with the novels, the animated version of Anne is much beloved in Japan to this day and "DVD memorial BOX set" (Region 2) was released on August 22, 2008 and a new anime series that serves as a prequel to the series, Kon'nichiwa Anne: Before Green Gables, which premiered on April 5, 2009 in Japan.
As of October 2014, the series is airing in North America on TV Japan.



Story
Anne Shirley is a girl raised in an orphanage. She is an imaginative and talkative girl. One day, Anne was accidentally sent to Miss Marilla Cuthbert and Mr. Matthew Cuthbert, who had originally requested a boy. Miss Marilla was surprised at first. After knowing Anne's sad past, she gradually becomes an irreplaceable member of the family of Cuthbert.
Summary
This anime was directed by Isao Takahata. He chose to make this animated version very true to the original source material, although his two previous works (Heidi, Girl of the Alps and 3000 Leagues in Search of Mother) had been adapted and altered.
Hayao Miyazaki did the scene setting and layout. Previously, he had worked on 3000 Leagues in Search of Mother, although he left the production and Nippon Animation after the first 15 episodes. Miyazaki noticed a difference in Takahata's philosophy of animation; Takahata stuck to controlled, realistic acting at the time, similar to his former work. Miyazaki had not intended to do other work with Takahata, but he had also not planned on becoming independent in this season of his work.
Yoshifumi Kondo (近藤喜文) was selected for character design and animation director over Yoichi Kotabe (小田部羊一), who had stopped work with Takahata after 3000 Leagues in Search of Mother of the previous work. Kondo went on to work with Takahata on the films Grave of the Fireflies and Only Yesterday. The voice of Anne was provided by Eiko Yamada, who would become a staple of World Masterpiece Theatre anime, going on to play Lavinia in Princess Sarah and Jo March in Little Women (the latter of which also featured character designs by Kondo).

About Founder
Mr. Gopal Mathur is a founder of the college, who is having more than 26 years of establishing & controlling the companies and professional set-ups. He started with a business of plants Nursery in the year 1983 with a name Krishna Nursery & Agricultural Farms. The business is now spread in large areas and is one of Uttarakhand’s biggest Nursery with some of its sister concerns named Durga Nursery, Krishna Nursery at Ballupur Area and Corporate Landscaping.
The nursery is providing its unique trees and plants to almost all prestigious organizations of Dehradun like IMA, Petroleum University, Max Hospital, Mahant Inderesh Hospital and many others.
Along with this, he is now investing his funds and time in establishing infrastructure and culture of Kelvin Institute. He is supported by his only son, Mr.Ankit Mathur who is holding a prestigious position of Chairman in college. Mr.Ankit is an MBA in Finance & IT from Amity University, Noida. He also holds the chair of Director in his own established IT company, Kalosoft Systems Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
Conflicts & Contradictions
Since the establishment of college in 2012, the college premises, students and staff of Kelvin had witnessed many success, conflicts, contradictions and challenges
Under-19 Events Under-19 Events was the name of open event organized in month of May in year 2013. It was a competition open for all children having age under 19 years. The categories of event were Modeling & Talent, Cricket, football, Athletics, Carom, Chess, LAN Gaming, Quiz Competition, Shot put, Badminton and sketching. The event held on 16,17,18 and 19 May. Although the event was a success in all terms, but due to its vastness and participation of more than 300 children, there were some obvious situations of misunderstanding. One such situation happened during final game of Football. The match was between the Team of KVI FRI and the local area team. Since football is game of passion and excitement, there were some verbal arguments between players of both teams. The matter was getting exaggerated but was wisely controlled by Founder and Chairman of the college. Other games also has some tiny conflicts like losing team in Quiz competition had some disagreement over decision, 100 meters race suffered from issue of conflicting position. These small things are obvious. But the events were success and after 3 days of excitement, the events came to an end with closing ceremony of prize distribution and cultural programs by participants.
Address Problem The college name is listed on Uttarakhand Technical University’s website but shows wrong address. It is because Kelvin initially started on rented building at Indira Nagar so university’s website has that address. The request is already been made for change in address but is still pending due to some internal reasons of the university.
Under-Constructed Buildings Students of academic session 2012-13 were to be shifted to their permanent campus with all required infrastructure & facilities like computer lab, library, classrooms, staff room, internet, canteen. For fresher students of session 2013-14, the campus was sufficient but was lacking a well organized administrative area. So the construction started in full swing in month of August 2013 and by Feb 2014, the administrative area having offices of Chairman, Founder, Reception, Admission Counselor, etc. was completed.

Percy Lenard Howard (born January 21, 1952 in Savannah, Georgia) is a former American football wide receiver in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys in 1975. He was an unlikely star for the Cowboys in Super Bowl X.



Early years
Howard attended Dillard High School where he participated in basketball, football and Track and Field, specializing in the 100 and 200 yard dash. He went on to play college basketball at Austin Peay University, where he averaged 12.4 points and 7.3 rebounds per game during three varsity seasons (1972-73 through 1974-75). The 6-4, 215-pound forward was an All-OVC selection in 1974-75 and averaged seven points and seven rebounds per game in four NCAA Tournament contests in 1973 and 1974. He was also a teammate of the legendary James "Fly" Williams.
Professional career
Although Howard didn't play football at Austin Peay University, the Dallas Cowboys saw a tremendous athlete and signed him to an undrafted free agent contract in 1975. With that contract, Howard became one of only a handful of college athletes to reach the NFL without playing any college football.
In the first preseason game, while returning a kick against the Los Angeles Rams, his cheekbone was fractured when one of his teammates knocked a defender into his path just as he was speeding toward a hole. The injury delayed his development several weeks, but he still made the team as a wide receiver and kickoff returner. Howard was the third receiver on the Cowboys during the 1975 season, unfortunately for him, the top two receivers Drew Pearson and Golden Richards played virtually every offensive snap, and the Cowboys did not use formations with three receivers. He played primarily on special teams during the regular season, and his only statistical contributions were a pair of kickoff returns for 51 total yards.
That season the team reached Super Bowl X, which ended up being something of a homecoming for Howard, because the Cowboys were encamped in Fort Lauderdale. In fact, when the Dallas charter landed at the airport, the Dillard High School marching band was there to greet him.
Late in Super Bowl X, Howard got a rare opportunity to play on offense, when Richards broke a rib. With the Pittsburgh Steelers leading by 11 points with less than two minutes to go, Howard caught a 34-yard touchdown pass from Roger Staubach over Mel Blount, cutting the deficit to four points. A late turnover by the Steelers gave the Cowboys a shot to win the game at the end, and Howard was again involved on a last-second Hail Mary pass by Staubach, however he had three Steelers on him, and when he leaped to make the catch, the ball was tipped away.
The following year big things were expected from Howard, but in a 1976 preseason game against the Denver Broncos, he severely injured his right knee while running a reverse. He spent the rest of the season rehabilitating the knee, only to be injured again during a practice in the 1977 training camp, causing him to miss the entire season. He would never recover from his injury and the Cowboys eventually released him in 1978.
The 34 yard touchdown catch in Super Bowl X, turned out to be Howard's only career reception and his last game in the NFL. Still, he would become part of the Cowboys lore and was named #6 on NFL Top 10's Top Ten One-Shot Wonders.

The Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) is a military, all-weather landing system based on real-time differential correction of the GPS signal, augmented with a local area correction message, and transmitted to the user via secure means. The onboard receiver compares the current GPS-derived position with the local correction signal, deriving a highly accurate three-dimensional position capable of being used for all-weather approaches via an ILS-style display. While JPALS is similar to Local Area Augmentation System, but intended primarily for use by the military, some elements of JPALS may eventually see their way into civilian use to help protect high-value civilian operations against unauthorized signal alteration.

History

The development of JPALS was a result of two main military requirements. First, the military needs an all-service, highly mobile all-weather precision approach system, tailorable to a wide range of environments, from shipboard use to rapid installation at makeshift airfields. Second, they need a robust system that can maintain a high level of reliability in combat operations, particularly in its ability to effectively resist jamming.
Operation
JPALS encompasses two main categories: SRGPS and LDGPS. SRGPS provides highly accurate approach positioning for operations aboard ship, including aircraft carriers, helo and STO/VL carriers, and other shipboard operations, primarily, but not limited to, helicopter operations.
LDGPS is further divided into three sub-categories: Fixed Base, Tactical, and Special Missions. Fixed Base is used for ongoing operations at military airfields around the world, while the Tactical system is portable, designed for relatively short-term, austere airfield operations. The Special Missions system is a highly portable system capable of rapid installation and use by Special Forces.
Accuracy
The accuracy of LAAS, or Local Area Augmentation System, is better than CAT III ILS accuracy, and will provide horizontal and vertical resolutions of less than 1 m. Although the exact accuracy of JPALS will remain classified, it's estimated that JPALS will meet or exceed this accuracy for authorized users.
Benefits
The main benefit of JPALS is that it's a system that can be taken anywhere, anytime, providing a safe and effective way to conduct 24/7, all-weather, anti-jam instrument landing system capability to all authorized users, worldwide. A secondary benefit is a significant reduction in cost over current systems.
The naval version of JPALS transmits a signal that has a low probability of intercept. Therefore, it is unlikely that an enemy will detect the signal and trace it back to its source. The existing system, TACAN, is not encrypted or concealed in any way, which can reveal the location of the ship on which it is installed. This is not acceptable in emissions control (EMCON) or stealth conditions.
The increase in both accuracy and reliability will significantly enhance operations while reducing non-operational periods due to weather or adversarial efforts.

The phrase "Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad" is spoken by Prometheus in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem "The Masque of Pandora". Another version ("Those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad") is quoted as a "heathen proverb" in Daniel, a Model for Young Men (1854) by William Anderson Scott (1813–1885).
A prior Latin version is "Quos Deus vult perdere, prius dementat" (Life of Samuel Johnson, 1791) but this involves (presumably the Christian) God, not 'the gods'; an earlier version has Jupiter and the thought can be traced back to the play Antigone by Sophocles but even this appears to be a borrowing from an earlier, lost Greek play (see Euripides Misattributions).Lévy Makani is a Congolese politician and doctor in sciences. Professor Makani was named Minister of National Education in the government of Ambroise Noumazalaye formed on April 26, 1966.

Simon Kean (born January 11, 1989) from Trois-Rivières, Quebec is a Canadian boxer and violent criminal, that qualified for the 2012 Olympics along with Custio Clayton.
Simon was a semi-finalist and 3rd place finisher at super heavyweight at the 2012 American Boxing Olympic Qualification Tournament. Three spots were available for qualification for super heavyweight and Simon qualified over the other semi-finalist since his loss was a KO by the eventual winner Ítalo Perea. Qualification being dependent on how the fighter a boxer lost to performed in later rounds was controversial and will not be used in future Olympics.
At the 2012 Olympics he edged out Tony Yoka but lost to Ivan Dychko.
Criminal activity
Simon Kean has committed a series of violent assaults and has threatened to kill people in Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada. He has served a 10 month prison sentence. He can no longer own firearms in Canada and has lost his driver's license for a period of 1 year for driving under the influence of alcohol, for this he was fined $1300. He is not allowed to consume alcohol for a period of 15 months and is following a 2 year alcoholic treatment program. Simon Kean's DNA is now registered with the RCMP due to his high probability of committing violent crimes.

The Hiram M. Chittenden Locks is a complex of locks that sits at the west end of Salmon Bay, part of Seattle, Washington's Lake Washington Ship Canal. They are known locally as the Ballard Locks after the neighborhood to the north. (Magnolia lies to the south.)
The locks and associated facilities serve three purposes:
To maintain the water level of the fresh water Lake Washington and Lake Union at 20–22 feet (6.1–6.7 m) above sea level (Puget Sound's mean low tide).
To prevent the mixing of sea water from Puget Sound with the fresh water of the lakes (saltwater intrusion).
To move boats from the water level of the lakes to the water level of Puget Sound, and vice versa.
The complex includes two locks, 30 ft × 150 ft (9.1 m × 45.7 m) (small) and 80 ft × 825 ft (24 m × 251 m) (large). The complex also includes a 235 ft (72 m) spillway with six 32 ft × 12 ft (9.8 m × 3.7 m) gates to assist in water-level control. A fish ladder is integrated into the locks for migration of anadromous fish, notably salmon.
The grounds feature a visitors center, as well as the Carl S. English, Jr., Botanical Gardens.
Operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the locks were formally opened on July 4, 1917, although the first ship passed on August 3, 1916. They were named after U.S. Army Major Hiram Martin Chittenden, the Seattle District Engineer for the Corps of Engineers from April 1906 to September 1908. They were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

The locks proper

As noted above, the complex includes two locks. Using the small lock when boat traffic is low conserves fresh water during summer, when the lakes receive less inflow. Having two locks also allows one of the locks to be drained for maintenance without blocking all boat traffic. The large lock is drained for approximately 2-weeks, usually in November, and the small lock is drained for about the same period, usually in March.

The locks can elevate a 760-by-80-foot (232 m × 24 m) vessel 26 ft (7.9 m), from the level of Puget Sound at a very low tide to the level of freshwater Salmon Bay, in 10–15 minutes. The locks handle both pleasure boats and commercial vessels, ranging from kayaks to fishing boats returning from the Bering Sea to cargo ships. Over 1 million tons of cargo, fuel, building materials, and seafood products pass through the locks each year.
How the locks work

Vessels passing from the freshwater Lakes Washington and Union to Puget Sound enter the lock chamber through the open upper gates (A in the accompanying diagram). The lower gates (B) and the draining valve (D) are closed. The vessel is assisted by the lockwall attendants who assure it is tied down and ready for the chamber to be drained.
Next, the upper gates (A) and the filling valve (C) are closed and the draining valve (D) is opened allowing water to drain via gravity out to Puget Sound.
When the water pressure is equal on both sides of the gate, the lower gates (B) are opened, allowing the vessels to leave the lock chamber.
The process is reversed for upstream locking.

Spillway

South of the small lock is a spillway dam with tainter gates used to regulate the freshwater levels of the ship canal and lakes. The gates on the dam release or store water to maintain the lake within a 2 ft (0.61 m) range of 20 to 22 ft (6.1 to 6.7 m) above sea level. Maintaining this lake level is necessary for floating bridges, mooring facilities, and vessel clearances under bridges.
"Smolt flumes" in the spillway help young salmon to pass safely downstream. Higher water levels are maintained in the summer to accommodate recreation as well as to allow the lakes to act as a water storage basin in anticipation of drought conditions.
Salt water barrier
If excessive salt water were allowed to migrate into Salmon Bay, the salt could eventually damage the freshwater ecosystem. To prevent this, a basin was dredged just above (east of) the large lock. The heavier salt water settles into the basin and drains through a pipe discharging downstream of the locks area. In 1975, the saltwater drain was modified to divert some salt water from the basin to the fish ladder, where it is added via a diffuser to the fish ladder attraction water; see below.
To further restrict saltwater intrusion, in 1966, a hinged barrier was installed just upstream of the large lock. This hollow metal barrier is filled with air to remain in the upright position, blocking the heavier salt water. When necessary to accommodate deep-draft vessels, the barrier is flooded and sinks to the bottom of the chamber.
Fish ladder



The fish ladder at the Chittenden locks is unusual—materials published by the federal government say "unique"—in being located where salt and fresh water meet. Normally, fish ladders are located entirely within fresh water.
Pacific salmon are anadromous; they hatch in lakes, rivers, and streams—or, nowadays fish hatcheries—migrate to sea, and only at the end of their life return to fresh water to spawn. When the Corps of Engineers first built the locks and dam, they changed the natural drainage route of Lake Washington. The locks and dam blocked all salmon runs out of the Cedar River watershed. To correct this problem, the Corps built a fish ladder as the locks were constructed to allow salmon to pass around the locks and dam.
The ladder was designed to use attraction water: fresh water flowing swiftly out the bottom of the fish ladder, in the direction opposite which anadromous fish migrate at the end of their lives. However, the attraction water from this first ladder was not effective. Instead, most salmon used the locks. This made them an easy target for predators; also, many were injured by hitting the walls and gates of the locks, or by hitting boat propellers.
The Corps rebuilt the fish ladder in 1976 by increasing the flow of attraction water and adding more weirs: most weirs are now one foot higher than the previous one. The old fish ladder had only 10 "steps"; the new one has 21. A diffuser well mixes salt water gradually into the last 10 weirs. As a part of the rebuilding, the Corps also added an underground chamber with a viewing gallery.
The fish approaching the ladder smell the attraction water, recognizing the scent of Lake Washington and its tributaries. They enter the ladder, and either jump over each of the 21 weirs or swim though tunnel-like openings. They exit the ladder into the fresh water of Salmon Bay. They continue following the waterway to the lake, river, or stream where they were born. Once there, the females lay eggs, which the males fertilize. Most salmon die shortly after spawning.
The offspring remain in the fresh water until they are ready to migrate to the ocean as smolts. In a few years, the surviving adults return, climb the fish ladder, and reach their spawning ground to continue the life cycle. Of the millions of young fish born, only a relative few survive to adulthood. Causes of death include natural predators, commercial and sport fishing, disease, low stream flows, poor water quality, flooding, and concentrated developments along streams and lakes.
Visitors to the locks can observe the salmon through windows as they progress along their route. Although the viewing area is open year-round, the "peak" viewing time is during spawning season, from about the beginning of July through mid-August. A public art work, commissioned by the Seattle Arts Commission, provides literary interpretation of the experience through recordings of Seattle poet Judith Roche's "Salmon Suite," a sequence of five poems tied to the annual migratory sequence of the fish.

Among the species of salmonids migrating routinely through the ladder at the Chittenden Locks are Chinook (king) salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), Coho (silver) salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Sockeye (red) salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss).

Christopher Vincent Metzen (born November 22, 1973) is an American game designer, artist, voice actor and author known for his work creating the fictional universes and scripts for Blizzard Entertainment's three major award-winning media franchises: Warcraft, Diablo and StarCraft. On occasion, Metzen has published his art under the alias "Thundergod". Metzen was hired by Blizzard Entertainment as an animator and an artist; his first work for the company was with the video game Justice League Task Force.
Metzen is currently the Senior Vice President of Story and Franchise Development at Blizzard Entertainment and has assisted the company's projects by providing voice talent for a number of characters, as well as contributing to artistic character design. Outside of Blizzard Entertainment, Metzen authored a graphic novel series based on a futuristic second American civil war.
In his most recent side-project, Metzen co-authored the "digital-only" series turned Trade Paperback release, Transformers: Autocracy with author Flint Dille and artist Livio Ramondelli. The same team is current working on the follow-up series, "Transformers: Monstrosity".



Career
Metzen began his career in design after applying to Blizzard Entertainment, then known as Chaos Studios, on the recommendation of a friend who had seen his work. He was quickly recruited by the company, although Metzen states that at the time he did not really know what Blizzard Entertainment dealt with, assuming it was a graphic design studio rather than a video game developer.
Metzen's first work for the company was with the game Justice League Task Force, in which he provided artwork and character animation. Around the same time, Metzen also contributed to 1994's Warcraft: Orcs and Humans by working on artwork, illustrations and the game's documentation. Later video games by Blizzard Entertainment would frequently include Metzen's work in manual design, illustration and concept art. However, Metzen's role in developing later Warcraft games increased significantly with 1995's Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness, which gave him the opportunity to work on the game's fantasy-based fictional universe in addition to designing the game's various scenarios and missions.
In 1996, Blizzard Entertainment launched its second major franchise with the role-playing game Diablo. Diablo‍ '​s fictional universe was created by both Metzen and fellow designer Bill Roper, and Metzen also provided voice acting for some of the game's characters. On occasion, Metzen would provide voice talent for later video games. In 1998 he took the role of lead designer on the science fiction strategy game StarCraft. Along with James Phinney, Metzen again provided the game's extensive story and script, as well as organizing the voice casting for the game. In 1999, Metzen wrote a short story set in the StarCraft universe with fellow Blizzard Entertainment employee Sam Moore. The story, entitled Revelations, was published in the spring issue of Amazing Stories with cover artwork by Samwise Didier. Returning to the Diablo series in 2000 with Diablo II, Metzen worked on the game's story, script and artwork. In 2001, he published a novel set in the Warcraft universe, entitled Of Blood and Honor.
With 2002's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, Metzen was the creative director, a role he would hold in all of Blizzard's later video games, and provided the game's story concept and script. Metzen's work with 2004's massively multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft was not as extensive as his earlier work, but he still contributed with script writing, artwork and voice work.
Metzen announced in early 2005 that he was working on a graphic novel series independent of Blizzard Entertainment. The series, entitled Soldier: 76, is set in a second American civil war in 2010, with increased domestic and global terror threats and the increase in power for the US federal government over that of local state governments serving as a background. Metzen wrote the series' script, while Brazilian artist Max Velati was responsible for the illustration and painting of the book.
Chris Metzen teamed with author Flint Dille and artist Livio Ramondelli to create the 12-part, bi-weekly digital comic series, Transformers: Autocracy. Autocracy, published by IDW Publishing was published in 2012. The series focuses on the days just before the Great War. It is set after Megatron Origin, and presents the Decepticons as an established force, sowing dissent across Cybertron primarily through terrorist actions. The series focuses on Orion Pax, an Autobot commander charged with rooting out these cells. Transformers: Autocracy was released as a collected Trade Paperback in July of 2012 with a bonus forward authored by Metzen. The same team is current working on the follow-up series, "Transformers: Monstrocity".
In Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty, Metzen voices the marine and battlecruiser unit.
Personal life
He first started creating comics at the age of twelve, but that he had held an interest in drawing since at least six. He states that he still retains a habit of spending "an average of thirty-five dollars per week" on comics books. A fan of Dungeons  Dragons, Metzen cites the Dragonlance series of novels and Star Wars as the primary inspirations for his fantasy and science fiction creations, and names fantasy and comic book artists such as Walt Simonson and Keith Parkinson as his artistic inspirations.
He defines his artistic style as having been "heavily influenced by Walt Simonson's and Jim Lee's pencilling styles for form" while preferring the "costuming, themes and general feel of Larry Elmore and Keith Parkinson's fantasy paintings". In addition to art, Metzen's interests include pop and rock music, the nightlife, and dirt bikes. On April 21, 2013, Metzen married his longtime girlfriend Kat Hunter, who is a licensing project manager at Blizzard Entertainment.

Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too is a 1974 animated feature from Disney released as a double feature with The Island at the Top of the World. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, but lost to Closed Mondays. It was later added as a segment to the 1977 film The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. A soundtrack album was released simultaneously and featured such songs as "The Honey Tree" and "Birthday, Birthday." The film, whose name is a play on the slogan "Tippecanoe and Tyler too" made famous during the 1840 United States presidential election, is based on the fourth and seventh chapters of The House at Pooh Corner, the second Winnie-the-Pooh book by A. A. Milne.



Plot
During the fall, Tigger has been bouncing on anyone he comes across for fun, especially Rabbit when he is gardening, which angers Rabbit, so he calls a meeting with Pooh and Piglet and formulates a plan to abandon Tigger in the woods, and find him the next day so hopefully Tigger will stop bouncing on his friends unexpectedly. Initially the plan seems to work, but when Rabbit, Pooh, and Piglet cannot find their way home, Pooh makes a suggestion about following a sandpit in order to find their way out of the forest. In an attempt to prove Pooh wrong, Rabbit wanders away. Pooh and Piglet then fall asleep, but are woken by Pooh's empty stomach. He explains to Piglet that his honeypots have been calling to his tummy from home and that he couldn't hear them over Rabbit's voice. Pooh and Piglet find their way out of the forest, but are immediately bounced by Tigger. Piglet, realizing that the plan failed, mentions Rabbit's plan, and Tigger goes into the forest to find him. Rabbit walks through the forest by himself, and is scared by numerous noises such as a caterpillar eating a leaf and frogs croaking. Rabbit tries to run away in a panic, only to be tackled by Tigger. Rabbit is humiliated that his plan to lose Tigger had failed. Tigger explains to him that "Tiggers never get lost", and takes Rabbit home.
Wintertime comes and Roo wants to go play. Kanga cannot be with him so she calls on Tigger to look after Roo as long as he comes back in time for Roo's nap. Tigger gladly accepts. Along the way through the woods, Tigger and Roo see Rabbit skating on the ice. Tigger tries to teach Roo how to ice skate by doing it himself, but unfortunately, he loses his balance and collides with Rabbit while trying to regain it. In moments Tigger slides into a snowbank and Rabbit crashes into his house. Tigger then decides that he does not like ice skating. Later on, while bouncing around the woods with Roo on his back, Tigger accidentally jumps to the top of a very tall tree and is afraid to climb back down. He gets even more scared when Roo uses his tail as a swing, making Tigger think he's "rocking the forest".
Meanwhile, Pooh and Piglet are investigating strange animal tracks that are actually Tigger and Roo's. Suddenly, they hear Tigger howling, for help and quickly hide. At first, Pooh mistakes Tigger's howl for the sound of a "Jagular"; but after seeing that it is actually Tigger and Roo in the tree, he and Piglet come to the rescue. Shortly afterward, Christopher Robin, Rabbit, and Kanga arrive and the gang uses Christopher's coat as a net for Tigger and Roo to land in once they jump from the tree. Roo successfully jumps down, but Tigger, who is still too frightened to move, makes up several excuses to not come down. Rabbit then decides that the group will just have to leave Tigger in the tree forever, on which Tigger promises never to bounce again if he ever is released from his predicament. At that moment, the narrator chimes in for help. Tigger begs him to "narrate" him down from the tree, and he tilts the book sideways, allowing Tigger to step onto the text of the page. Tigger starts to feel better that he made it this far but before he can do otherwise, the narrator tilts the book back the other way, causing Tigger to fall into the snow.
Happy, Tigger attempts to bounce but Rabbit stops him reminding Tigger of the promise he made. Devastated, Tigger realizes he cannot bounce anymore and slowly walks away and Rabbit feels better that there will be peace, but everyone else does not and felt sad to see Tigger depressed and remind Rabbit of the joy Tigger brought when he was bouncing. Then Rabbit shows sympathy for Tigger and takes back the promise they had agreed on; he is then given a friendly tackle by an overly-excited Tigger. Tigger invites everyone to bounce with him and even teaches Rabbit how to do it. For the first time, Rabbit is happy to be bouncing, as is everyone else as Tigger sings his signature song once more before the short closes.

ReferencesThe Roots Radics Band was formed in 1978 by bass player Errol "Flabba" Holt, guitarist Eric "Bingy Bunny" Lamont and drummer Lincoln "Style" Scott. They were joined by many musicians, including guitarist Noel "Sowell" Bailey, Dwight Pinkney and Steve Golding, keyboard player Wycliffe "Steelie" Johnson, and saxophonist Headley Bennett. As a combined force the Roots Radics became a well-respected studio and stage band, which dominated the sound in the first half of the 1980s. They supported artists like Bunny Wailer, Gregory Isaacs and Israel Vibration and have released several albums to their name as well. As an aside, 'Radics' sounds very much like 'Radix', which is the Latin word for 'Root' also.
Somewhere late in 1979 the band recorded the riddims for Barrington Levy's first songs for producer Henry "Junjo" Lawes, credited at the time as the Channel One Stars. With hindsight these riddims are now considered the birth of Jamaican dancehall music.
As a sought after studio lineup, Roots Radics backed several well known reggae stars in the studio and on tour. For example, they appear on several Eek-A-Mouse albums: Bubble Up Yu Hip (1980), Wa-Do-Dem (1981), Skidip (1982), The Mouse and the Man (1983) and Assassinator (1983). They backed reggae superstar Gregory Isaacs on his classic album Night Nurse (1982), and are often credited on releases by Prince Far I, both on his solo recording work, and as part of producer Adrian Sherwood's studio supergroup Singers and Players.
Johnson went on to become half of the production duo Steely and Clevie. Bailey died from cancer in July 2014, aged 61. Lincoln 'Style' Scott was found dead in his home 9th October 2014

Ram Kumar Dwivedi is a small village of Pali district, Rajasthan, India.

The Olympic Peninsula is the large arm of land in western Washington that lies across Puget Sound from Seattle. It is bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, the north by the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the east by Hood Canal. Cape Alava, the westernmost point in the contiguous United States, and Cape Flattery, the northwesternmost point, are on the peninsula. Comprising about 3600 square miles, the Olympic Peninsula contained many of the last unexplored places in the contiguous United States. It remained largely unmapped until Arthur Dodwell and Theodore Rixon mapped most of its topography and timber resources between 1898 and 1900.

Geography
The Olympic Peninsula is home to temperate rain forests, including the Hoh, Queets Rain Forest, and Quinault. Rain forest vegetation is concentrated primarily in the western part of the peninsula, as the interior mountains create a rain shadow effect in areas to the northeast, resulting in a much drier climate in those locales.
The Olympic mountain range sits in the center of the Olympic Peninsula. This range is the second-largest in Washington State. Its highest peak is Mt. Olympus.
Major salmon-bearing rivers on the Olympic Peninsula include, clockwise from the southwest: the Humptulips, the Quinault, the Queets, the Quillayute, Bogachiel, the Sol Duc, the Lyre, the Elwha (see Elwha Ecosystem Restoration), the Dungeness, the Dosewallips, the Hamma Hamma, the Skokomish, and the Wynoochee River.
Natural lakes on the peninsula include Kitsap Lake, Lake Crescent, Lake Ozette, Lake Sutherland, Lake Quinault, and Lake Pleasant. Two dammed rivers form the reservoirs of Lake Cushman and Wynoochee Lake; two previous reservoirs, destroyed in the Elwha Ecosystem Restoration, included Lake Aldwell (behind the former Elwha Dam) and Lake Mills (behind the former Glines Canyon Dam).
The peninsula contains many state and national parks, including Anderson Lake, Bogachiel, Dosewallips, Fort Flagler, Fort Worden, Kitsap Memorial, Lake Cushman, Manchester, Mystery Bay, Old Fort Townsend, Potlatch, Sequim Bay, Shine Tidelands, and Triton Cove state parks; Olympic National Park; and the Olympic National Forest. Within the Olympic National Forest, there are five designated wilderness areas: The Brothers, Buckhorn, Colonel Bob, Mt. Skokomish, and Wonder Mountain. Just off the west coast is the Washington Islands Wilderness.
A major effort called the Wild Olympics campaign is under way to protect additional wilderness areas on the Olympic National Peninsula, protect salmon streams under the Wild and Scenic River Act and provide a means for Olympic National Park to offer to buy land adjacent to the Park from willing sellers.
Clallam and Jefferson Counties, as well as the northern parts of Grays Harbor and Mason Counties, are on the peninsula. The Kitsap Peninsula, bounded by the Hood Canal and the Puget Sound, is an entirely separate peninsula and is not connected to the Olympic Peninsula.
From Olympia, the state capital, U.S. Route 101 runs along the Olympic Peninsula's southern edge and up the western and northern shorelines.
Politics
The Olympic Peninsula is represented in the U.S. House of Representatives by Derek Kilmer.

Eve was an illustrated magazine for women published in London.
History and profile
Already in existence in the 1920s, in 1926 it took over a long-established British publication called The Gentlewoman, which was merged into it.
An unrelated monthly magazine using the same title was launched by BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of the BBC, in 2000. Created under a working title Project Urma, the first edition was dated September 2000 and was sold on newstands from early August 2000.
As with much BBC activity at the time, the magazine attracted criticism from those who believed that the broadcaster was over-reaching by using its licence-fee funded programming to promote commercial activities, harming other businesses.
Although the magazine was a circulation success, a 2005 restructuring of the BBC led to the decision to sell the title as it didn't directly support a programme. Haymarket Media Group purchased Eve with the intention of building a women's magazine business around the publication.
Haymarket's stewardship of Eve was not a success, and circulation started to decline. In April 2008, there was an overhaul which saw a new masthead and a revamped format, but the global financial crisis of 2007–08 and the advertising downturn which followed made the title too unprofitable for Haymarket, and in September 2008 the company announced its closure.
ReferencesMichelle Fraley (née Hernández) is the first Puerto Rican woman to graduate from West Point Military Academy and the former chief of staff of the Army Network Enterprise Technology Command. After a 30-year military career, she retired from the United States Army in 2014 and returned to Puerto Rico, where she was appointed as special assistant to the Puerto Rico Police Superintendent, leading the Strategic Initiative Group. Subsequent to the resignation of James Tuller, the Police Superintendent who recruited her, her name surfaced as a potential successor.
Her final of six commanding posts before retiring was as commander of the Walter Reed Warrior Transition Brigade (WTB) in the National Capital Area. As she completed her final post, she was described as a "Wonder Woman" in dealing with wounded warriors that returned from the battlefront to assume other roles in the military or transition into private life.
Upon settling in Puerto Rico with her husband after retiring on January 27, 2014, she turned in a resume to Superintendent Tuller and was appointed to the $72,000-year job, where Fraley, who holds two Masters' degrees and a PhD in organizational leadership, is charged with analyzing the entire state police organization. Her appointment, while controversial, has been endorsed by the ACLU's Puerto Rico Chapter. The Puerto Rico Police Department operates under a consent decree with the United States Department of Justice. A Federal court-appointed monitor, supervised by United States District Judge Gustavo Gelpí, resigned in February, 2014.
She studied at the Nuestra Señora de la Providencia Catholic School in the Cupey sector of San Juan and graduated from Robinson School before moving on to West Point. Her 5-year military commitment after graduating turned into a 30-year military career.

In the 2009 provincial elections the party obtained a remarkable result for a new party: 1.1% in Milan, 1.6% in Monza, 1.6% in the Lecco, 0.9% in Brescia, 1.1% in Verona and 1.1% in Venice (where it was in alliance with the Italian-nationalist Tricolour Flame).
In 2011 the party formed an alliance with Future and Freedom and gained 1.3% of the vote in the province of Vercelli. In the 2012 municipal elections the party had a breakthrough in Rovato, where it garnered 12.4% of the vote, but, apart from that, had dim results.

The UK Singles Chart is a record chart compiled by The Official Charts Company (OCC) on behalf of the British record industry. The chart week runs from Sunday to Saturday, with the top 40 singles being broadcast in on BBC Radio 1 in a chart show each Sunday. Until the end of 2004 the chart was based entirely on sales of physical singles from retail outlets, at which point legal music downloads were included in the compilation of the chart.
The list below shows all the singles that peaked in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart during 2004 (see 2004 in British music). The date in the "Top 10 Entry Date" column is the date that the single entered the top 10 for the first time. Songs that remained in the top 10 at the beginning of 2004 but peaked in 2003 are included in List of top 10 singles in 2003 (UK), as well as being noted below. Similarly, songs that entered the top 10 in 2004 but did not peak until 2005 are listed in List of top 10 singles in 2005 (UK) and underneath the table in this article.
Hey Ya! by the American band OutKast was the only single released in 2003 that peaked in 2004. Although the song first entered the top 10 in November 2003, it did not reach its peak of number three in the chart until February 2004. The 2003 Christmas number-one, "Mad World" by Michael Andrews featuring Gary Jules (which was recorded for the 2001 film Donnie Darko), remained at number-one for the first week of 2004. The first new number-one single of the year was "All This Time" by 2003 Pop Idol winner Michelle McManus. The release sent McManus into the Guinness Book of Records as the first Scottish female to reach the top of the charts with their debut single.

Kristo is a 1996 Filipino cinematic interpretation of the life of Jesus Christ. Produced in 1996 by Cine Suerte Productions and Oasis of Love Movement (by Fr. Sonny Ramirez, OP, host of the telemagazine Sharing in the City), Kristo stars Mat Ranillo III in the title role, together with Rez Cortez (as Judas Iscariot), Ruel Vernal (Peter), Michael Locsin (John), freelance model and then college student Charmaine Rivera (in her first and only film appearance as the Virgin Mary), and Amy Austria (Mary Magdalene).
The film also includes an all-star cast in their cameo appearances playing various characters. Among them are Gabby Concepción (John the Baptist), husband-and-wife pair Rudy Fernandez and Lorna Tolentino (as Simon of Cyrene and Veronica respectively), Aga Muhlach (the demon-possessed man), Rachel Lobangco (the Temptress, in which Satan is in a female form in the temptation of the desert scene), Silvia Sanchez (the adulteress), Ang TV star and singer Lindsay Custodio (Salome), and Christopher de Leon (as Dimas as credited in the film).

Plot/setting
The film started on a prologue, What if the Story of the New testament was replaced the setting, from the Middle East to the Philippine Islands, What would be the Image and culture of the new testament look like?
The narrative of Kristo is based on the combined Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, but imagined as occurring in Classical Filipino society with ethnic elements and some aspects of Ancient Rome and first-century Judaea. Kristo was shot in various locations such as Intramuros, Lawton and Luneta in Manila, as well as in Laguna and Pampanga.
The film starts with an open book presenting the Nativity of Jesus in the form of illustrations. Live action scenes or the flow of the story follows the next page 30 years after, beginning with the preaching of John the Baptist and the Baptism of Jesus in the River Jordan. Kristo cycles through the various episodes in Christ's ministry, his death, and resurrection, ending with his ascension and its illustrated version on the last page with a Biblical message.

Kong Chow Temple (traditional Chinese: 岡州古廟; simplified Chinese: 冈州古庙; pinyin: Gāngzhōu Gǔmiào; Jyutping: gong1 zau1 gu2 miu6) is a temple dedicated to Guan Di, located in the Chinatown neighborhood of San Francisco, California, in the United States.

History
The temple was founded, in 1849, by members of the Cantonese population of San Francisco. In 1854, the temple was renamed Kong Chow Clan Association, to stress the social activities planned by the temple. The Association provided social welfare and religious needs for the community. Like many buildings in the area, it was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and the community worked together to rebuild it.
Bess Truman's visit
Bess Truman visited the temple in 1948, where she prayed for positive results to her husband, Harry S. Truman's presidential run. While there, she also asked for a prediction about the results, due to the public's prediction that he would lose. While there, she held a container of Kau cim sticks, and shook them until one of the sticks fell to the ground. This stick was then exchanged for a piece of paper, which told a story, offering insight to her question. The prediction was favorable, and Truman would go on to win the presidential election. The prediction slip that was given to her is displayed in the temple.
Today
In 1977, the temple moved to its current building in Chinatown, known as the Kong Chow Building. The association works closely with the elderly population, offers scholarships and other charitable projects for the neighborhood. They also organize prayer sessions, and participates in the Qing Ming Festival. Inside of the temple is a sculpture of Guan Di, which serves as the main altar.

The Annunciation Triptych is an oil-on-panel triptych by the Netherlandish artist Rogier van der Weyden, dating from around 1434. It was originally formed by three panels, the central one being now at The Louvre museum in Paris, France; the side panels are at the Galleria Sabauda of Turin, northern Italy.

Description
It is an early work by the Netherlandish artist, with a visible re-elaborations of elements from Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck. The central panel depicts a composition within a domestic interior, with a richly dressed Angel surprising the Virgin who reads a book (a symbol of the Holy Books).
Van der Weyden paid attentions to technical details, such as the shining metallic objects, like the lamp, the jar, the medallion hanging over the bed. The horizon line is elevated like in other contemporary Neterlandish paintings.
The side panels have similar characteristics, but are set in more luminous landscapes, with the elements in the background becoming increasingly invisible in the haze, according to aerial perspective.

The 2010 Victorian state election was held on 27 November to elect members to all 88 Legislative Assembly seats and all 40 Legislative Council seats in the Parliament of Victoria. The incumbent centre-left Australian Labor Party government, led by John Brumby, was defeated by the centre-right Liberal/National Coalition opposition, led by Ted Baillieu. The election gave the Coalition a one-seat majority in both houses of parliament.
Victoria has compulsory voting and uses a mandatory preferential ballot in single-member seats for elections to the Legislative Assembly. By contrast, the single transferable vote in multi-member districts is used for elections to the Legislative Council. The election was conducted by the Victorian Electoral Commission (VEC).

Background

At the 1999 election, the Labor Party led by Steve Bracks was able to form a minority government with the parliamentary support of 3 Independents, displacing the incumbent Jeff Kennett Liberal/National Coalition government. Labor was returned with a majority government after a landslide win at the 2002 election. Labor was elected for a third term at the 2006 election with a substantial but reduced majority. Labor won 55 of the 88 seats, a decrease of 7, and 54.4 percent of the two-party preferred vote, a decrease of 3.4 percent. Brumby replaced Bracks as Labor leader and Premier of Victoria in 2007.
Political changes
The previous elections took place on Saturday, 25 November 2006. At the 2006 election, the Labor Party won 55 of the 88 seats, the Liberal Party won 23, the National Party won 9, and there was 1 Independent. Since that date a number of political changes took place.
Both Premier Bracks and Deputy Premier John Thwaites resigned on 27 July 2007.
By-elections
Between the 2006 and 2010 elections, four by-elections took place. In Bracks' seat of Williamstown and Thwaites' seat of Albert Park in 2007, former minister Andre Haermeyer's seat of Kororoit in 2008, and former minister Lynne Kosky's seat of Altona in 2010. All four seats were retained by Labor. Labor MP Craig Langdon resigned from his seat of Ivanhoe in August 2010, however the by-election writ was discharged by the Parliamentary Speaker due to the proximity of the state election coupled with the cost of holding a by-election.
Campaign


The Liberal and National Parties contested the election as a Coalition, which they had not done since the previous agreement lapsed in 2000. The Liberal Party departed from tradition and gave their preferences to Labor ahead of the Greens, thereby decreasing the chances of the Greens winning up to four inner city seats from Labor.
The Coalition launched their campaign on 14 November 2010 at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre in the electoral district of Melbourne, with the slogan: "Fix the problems. Build the future." Labor launched their campaign on 16 November 2010 in the electoral district of Bendigo East, using the slogan: "For the times ahead." The Greens ran with the slogan "This time, I'm voting Green".
Issues
The Coalition campaigned heavily against the Brumby Government's new Myki ticketing system, which had been delivered at triple the projected cost and years behind schedule, as well as its construction of an expensive desalination plant that many claimed was unnecessary. Other issues included health, education, and law and order. Ted Baillieu promised to restore the budget to surplus, employ more nurses and police, make Victorian teachers the highest paid in the country, and abolish suspended sentences which were seen as out of touch with community standards.

ReferencesThe River Mahon (Irish: an Mhachan) flows from the Comeragh Mountains in County Waterford, Ireland.
Falling down the 80-metre Mahon Falls and proceeding past the "Fairy Bush", the river then passes through the village of Mahon Bridge and on past Flahavan's Mill and under the 8-arched rail bridge in Kilmacthomas. In former times, the river powered five different mills, one at Mahon Bridge, three at Kilmacthomas and one at Ballylaneen. The river is joined by the Ách Mór tributary river at Ballylaneen and ends its journey three miles further downstream at Bunmahon on Ireland's south coast. It drains into the region of the Atlantic Ocean known as the Celtic Sea.
The river is popular with whitewater kayakers. There has been no known source-to-sea descent to date but the river has been paddled from Mahon Bridge to the sea at Bonmahon by an international team of B1 and B2 kayakers in August 2012.
On 21 October 2005, Michael Reynolds, a kayaker from Tramore, County Waterford, performed the only known descent in a kayak of the vertical 55 foot drop at the top of Mahon falls.

The Kentucky Fairness Alliance (KFA) was an American gay rights organization formed in 1993 and based in Kentucky. In 2013, KFA merged its assets under the auspices of the Louisville-based Fairness Campaign. KFA provided public education and advocacy on issues affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals and families in Kentucky.

History
Because of its role as an advocate for LGBT Kentuckians, the history of the Kentucky Fairness Alliance mirrors the legal and legislative issues affecting gay rights in Kentucky since the early 1990s. In 1993 a group of LGBT Kentuckians from across the Commonwealth, but principally from Louisville and Central Kentucky, formed the Kentucky Fairness Alliance Education Fund with the expressed purpose of educating the public on GLBT issues.
The organization's founders included Carla Wallace and Pam McMichael of Louisville; Pam Goldman and Keith Elston of Lexington; Barry Grossheim of Northern Kentucky; the Rev. Ben Guess of Henderson; and other activists from around the state. Many in this group came to the Kentucky Fairness Alliance from their involvement in groups like Louisville's Fairness Campaign and Lexington's Gay and Lesbian Service Organization. The group's formation was in part a response to attempts in the Kentucky General Assembly to recriminalize consensual sodomy after the Kentucky Supreme Court, in Kentucky v. Wasson overturned a statute making consensual oral or anal sex between members of the same sex illegal while allowing these sex acts between members of the opposite sex.

Kentucky Fairness Alliance held the 1st Annual Gay  Lesbian Film Series Kickoff Gala on May 30, 2008 in Louisville. The Human Rights Campaign was among the many sponsors of the event supporting Kentucky Fairness Alliance.

ReferencesFrom August 22 to August 24, 1992 violent xenophobic riots took place in the Lichtenhagen district of Rostock, Germany; these were the worst mob attacks against migrants in postwar Germany. Even though stones and petrol bombs were thrown at an apartment block where asylum seekers lived, no one was killed. At the height of the riots, several hundred militant right-wing extremists were involved, and about 3,000 neighbourhood onlookers stood by, applauding them.
The initial response of authorities and politicians was heavily criticised. For some days prior to the riots, veiled warnings of impending trouble had been posted in some newspapers. Police and politicians seemed reluctant to respond and when they did, their response was inadequate to meet the need. Outside the building where the refugees were housed, several hundred asylum seekers had been camping for several days with little or no access to basic facilities, contributing to escalating tensions in the neighbourhood.
Between August 22 and 26, 1992, there were 370 provisional arrests and 408 preliminary investigations related to the riots. Among the arrested were 110 people from former West Germany, 217 from the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, including 147 from Rostock and another 37 from the former East Germany. During the riot, 204 police officers were injured.

Background

The Zentrale Aufnahmestelle für Asylbewerber für Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (ZAst M-V), or "Central Refugee Shelter" for the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, was in an 11-storey plattenbau apartment complex known as the "Sunflower House" or "Sunflower Tower", because of the large sunflowers decorating one side. The building was notorious for the inhumane conditions under which the asylum seekers there were living and the lack of much (or any) support for them. The authorities ignored the numerous complaints from citizens and residents over the filthy and deplorable conditions in the apartment building.
Rioting
The shelter was originally intended to house 300 refugees a month, but by summer 1992 it was averaging 11,500 refugees per month. Primarily Roma from Romania, they were left by overstretched shelter staff to camp out in front of the building for days at a time. The municipal government refused to provide portable toilets and there was no water or garbage collection. Clashes between the homeless migrants and the Lichtenhagen residents increased. Neither the city nor the state government took action.
For days prior to the riots, the newspapers Norddeutsche Neueste Nachrichten and Ostsee-Zeitung had been calling for a "Lichtenhagen interest group". There were anonymous warnings that if by the weekend, the refugee shelter was not "cleaned up," order would be made. This gave young gang members from every corner of Rostock, normally enemies, a date, place and purpose to congregate. One 19-year old skinhead said, "The police know the Rostock Skins and 'Hools' [hooligans]. When something like this is announced, we're there!"
The first day's riot started with young people from the neighbourhood throwing stones. This was contained by the police, but media coverage encouraged neo-nazis to roam the area. This led to a situation where a xenophobic mob outnumbered the police by day three. The original target, the asylum accommodation, was evacuated on the second day, whereupon the mob stormed a neighbouring building in which 115 Vietnamese immigrants, a social worker and a ZDF television crew had mistakenly been left behind. While the building burned, they barricaded their doors against rioters, who were climbing over the balconies armed with baseball bats and Molotov cocktails. Below, a mob of over 5,000 spectators eagerly watched and applauded.
Charges of police and political incompetence were levelled from the beginning. One explanation cited for the lack of effective action by the police was that they were reluctant to take any action which might have been reminiscent of the recently cast-off communist police state. There were also charges that police and politicians were privately sympathetic to the anti-migrant sentiment.
The first major conviction relating to the riots was on March 4, 1993, though 24 convictions on lesser charges had already been handed down. A 22-year old man was convicted of throwing a firebomb at police, of seriously disturbing the peace, violating weapons laws and attempted bodily harm. An attempted murder charge was dropped for lack of evidence. Critics complained that no one was convicted of assaulting a foreigner, only of assaulting the police or of disorderliness. It took almost ten years to prosecute 408 people.
The following timeline was reconstructed by the "Legislative Committee to Investigate the Refugee Shelter Incident" ("Parlamentarischer Untersuchungsausschuss zu den Ereignissen um die ZAst").
Timeline
August 22, Day 1 From about 6:00 p.m. a large crowd assembled in front of the refugee shelter. At 8:02 p.m., thugs started attacking the shelter and violence escalated quickly. By 10:46pm, police were forced to retreat from the area. At 11:02 p.m. riot police arrived on the scene and were attacked with Molotov cocktails. At 11:24 p.m. another police unit arrived from Schwerin. At 1:34 a.m. Water cannons were set up and put in continuous use. Between 1:34 and 2:34 a.m., the rioters were pushed towards the autobahn. At 2:25 a.m. a water cannon vehicle was set on fire by a Molotov cocktail. At 2:30 a.m. Rostock police command declared a police emergency and the armoury was opened. Officers were issued tear gas and fired at the crowd. The situation calmed down by 5:30 a.m.
Day 1 Statistics: 160 police officers, 300 rioters, 13 police officers injured, nine arrests.
August 23, Day 2, Part 1
100 people gathered in front of the shelter.
At 11:15 a.m. Rostock police department requested back-up from other police departments. Squads responded from Schwerin, Anklam, Stralsund and Güstrow. The Landespolizei force of the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern sent two additional water cannons. Two reserve units (Einsatzhundertschaften) from the Federal Border Patrol (Bundesgrenzschutz) were activated. At 2:15 p.m. plainclothes officers reported the arrival of 30 known Neo-Nazis to the area.
August 23, Day 2, Part 2
At 6:45 p.m. about 400 rioters started attacking the shelter. At 7:18 p.m. the rioters started throwing Molotov cocktails. 8:00 p.m. The police used water cannons to clear the area. At 8:30 p.m. police resorted to firing live ammunition. At 10:00 p.m. the police officer in charge reported that without reinforcements, within 30 minutes, the situation would be impossible to control. At 10:30 p.m. a police car was set on fire. At 10:41 p.m. State police declared a state of emergency (Landespolizeialarm).
The state level of emergency allowed for additional, federal brigades to be pulled in. Hamburg sent out its SWAT (SEK and MBK) units. These riot police units, of about 100 officers each were reinforced by two police dog squads from Kiel, a reserve unit from Lübeck and helicopters from the federal police.
At 2:55 a.m. The 2nd Hamburg Unit arrived on the scene. At 3:45 a.m. the 1st Hamburg Unit arrived. At 4:10 a.m. The situation quieted down. The Hamburg units took over the night watch.
Day 2 Statistics: 850 police officers, 500 rioters, 70 police officers injured, 130 arrests.
August 24, Day 3, Part 1
2:00 p.m. Under the protection of the Hamburg units (now 16 hours in action) the shelter was evacuated. The large crowd of onlookers gave notice of a melee at 4:00 p.m. The police learnt of a telephone network that hooligans were using to organize the melee, which was to attack the police exclusively, if the shelter was cleared out.
August 24, Day 3, Part 2
7:45 p.m. Reinforcements from the 4th Brigade, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern arrived to replace the Hamburg riot units, now in action for 21 hours. 7:55 p.m. Ten minutes after the replacements arrived, an order was given to withdraw all protection for the shelter.
At 8:00 p.m. during the retreat from the building, Federal Border Patrol units reinforcing the 2nd Hamburg Unit came under attack. At this point, the crowd of cheering onlookers had grown to about 3,000. At 8:05 p.m. squads from the 2nd Hamburg Unit, which had already left the scene, were ordered back to reinforce the Border Patrol unit under attack. In order to push through the crowd, they resorted to using batons. The commanding officer of the 1st Hamburg Unit reported that the threat of violence was higher than what he had seen in his five years of experience in Hamburg's rioting hotspots, Hafenstraße and Flora.
At 8:15 p.m. The 1st Hamburg Unit and the 4th Brigade MV reached the other units. Water cannons were used and police cordons were formed. Rail transport police were radioed for back-up. The alarm was "Officers in distress." The 1st Hamburg Unit also provided support.
At 8:40 p.m. a technical problem knocked out one water cannon. At 9:20 p.m. the retreating 1st Hamburg Unit sought cover from the water cannon of the 4th Brigade, MV. At 9:34 p.m. The water supply of the second cannon ran out. The 4th Brigade MV of about 100 men, was up against 800 rioters. At 10:37 p.m. the 4th Brigade MV formed a police cordon and aimed the water cannon at the crowd to allow the fire department to get through. At 10:55 p.m. the 1st Hamburg Unit was sent back to Hamburg after 25 hours of duty. At midnight the 4th Brigade MV began "clearing out" the remaining roughly 300 hooligans, while the 2nd Hamburg Unit was sent back to Hamburg after 26 hours of duty. At 12:30 a.m. the area settled down.
At 2:00 a.m. 400 hooligans again began to storm the refugee shelter, using every means possible. The police had a strong presence and up to 7 water cannons were used to clear the streets surrounding the apartment complex. About 1,000-1,200 rioters took part in the melee with the police. By 3:00 a.m., the situation was under control.
Day 3 Statistics: 2050 police officers, 2000 rioters, 117 police officers injured, 58 arrests.
Copycat acts
In the week after the riots in Rostock, neo-Nazis put 40 residences at risk with firebombs and stones, and fought street battles with the police. In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in the following few days, the asylum centers in Wismar, Rostock-Hinrichshagen, Lübz and Neubrandenburg were attacked, and there were three such incidents in Greifswald. In Wismar there was a six-day riot, between 15 and 20 September, in front of the asylum center, whereas in Lichtenhagen there was applause from local residents. Even after that, there were almost daily attacks. On one weekend between Friday 18 September and Sunday 20 September, asylum centers in Güstrow Ueckermünde Kröpelin, Schwarzendorf (in the district of Malchin), Schwerin, Wismar and Retschow were repeatedly attacked with Molotov cocktails.
Legal proceedings
The attacks led to 370 arrests and 408 preliminary investigations. Prosecutions proved very difficult, as there was little reliable evidence. Overall, the legal process was judged to have been remarkably slow and consequences mild.
Cases were brought before the Regional Court of Rostock against 257 persons, most of which were dropped. Only 40 young people in 1993/94 were charged with rioting and arson. Most were given fines and suspended sentences. Eleven of those convicted were sent into youth custody ranging from seven months to three years, but only four of them were actually incarcerated, between two and three years, the other seven sentences were suspended. It took ten years after the riots for the last three cases to be concluded. The sentences were for 12 to 18 months in juvenile detention, or probation, although the then 17, 18 and 19 year olds, convicted of assault were sentenced not only for arson, but for attempted murder. The vast majority of those involved in the rioting remained anonymous and unpunished, despite the whole three days of rioting having been filmed by national German television, by the BBC, and other foreign news broadcasters.
An investigation against Rostock police chief Siegfried Kordus was discontinued in 1994. A case was made against the leader of the police operation, Chief Superintendent Jürgen Deckert, for criminally negligent arson by omission, but the case was dropped in 2000.

Tiarnán Mulvenna (born 10 December 1988) is an Irish footballer who plays as a forward for League of Ireland Premier Division side Drogheda United.



Football career
Tiarnán Mulvenna is a striker. He signed for Dundalk in 2006 after impressing in the youth team at Oriel Park. Although born in Belfast, Mulvenna grew up in Dundalk. Mulvenna is tipped for a big future in football. Before he signed for the club he was on trial at English League Two side Stockport County who were managed by former Lillywhites boss Jim Gannon.
Dundalk
Mulvenna was given a senior contract with Dundalk by manager John Gill in 2006 following a striker crisis at Oriel Park. In November 2006, Mulvenna was an unused substitute in a promotion/relegation play-off against Waterford United at the RSC. He had to wait until May 2007 to make his debut for the club when he came on as a substitute in the last five minutes against Athlone Town in a First Division match which Dundalk won 2-0 at Lissywoollen thanks to goals from Shaun Williams and Philip Hughes. His first ever career goal came at Oriel Park in September 2007 when he netted in a 4-0 win over Kilkenny City in the First Division. He made his name at the club when he scored twice in a 3-0 win over Monaghan United in the League of Ireland Cup First Round at Oriel Park in March 2008. He played a big part in Dundalk's First Division title winning season in 2008 as the Lillywhites got promoted to the Premier Division. Mulvenna was offered a full-time contract by the board of Dundalk for the 2009 season which he accepted. In the 2009 season Mulvenna played 29 league games but he played most this out on the wing which resulted in him only scoring 3 goals. Then in the 2010 season he found it hard to break into the team only making 7 league appearances which resulted in Mulvenna terminating his contact on the 19th of August 2010 citing lack of first team football as the reason behind leaving his home town club. After leaving Dundalk Mulvenna had been rumoured to join Newry City but then made the shock move to join local Dundalk side Woodview Celtic. Mulvenna signed for Shelbourne but there was a problem with his registration and found himself unable to sign for a club until June.
Drogheda United
In June he signed for Drogheda United and made his debut on 10 June 2011 against his former club Dundalk, in Oriel Park. Drogheda won 2-1. His first goals for the club came in a 3-1 win against U.C.D on 21 June 2011.
Return to Dundalk
Mulvenna re-joined Dundalk for the 2013 season.
Glenavon
On 13 January 2014, Mulvenna completed a move to Glenavon in the NIFL Premiership. He signed an 18-month deal for the club.
Cliftonville
On 22 August 2014, it was announced that Mulvenna had signed a two-year contract for reigning NIFL Premiership champions Cliftonville in a swap deal with Glenavon, which saw Cliftonville midfielder Ciaran Caldwell going to Mourneview Park in return.

The World We Live In and Live in Hamburg is the first video release by Depeche Mode, featuring almost an entire concert from their 1984 Some Great Reward Tour, at Alsterdorfer Sporthalle in Hamburg, Germany on 14 December 1984. It was directed by Clive Richardson. The name is a play on a lyric of the song "Somebody" (She will listen to me, when I want to speak about the world we live in and life in general...).
The number of songs on the video depends on the region. Some have eleven, some have seventeen. The seventeen-song version was re-released in 1999, though still on VHS, in Europe only and in Japan on other formats. It has yet to be released on DVD. The United States only has the 11-song version.
Two songs that were performed during the Hamburg concert, "Puppets" and "Ice Machine" (both written by ex member Vince Clarke) have yet to appear on any format. It is unclear why these were omitted from the original release.

Sung Si-kyung (born April 17, 1979) is a Korean ballad singer and actor.

Biography
Sung is well known for his soft voice and gentle image. Sung's undergraduate education (Bachelor of Arts in Sociology) took place at the Korea University, after which he received Master of Arts in Journalism and Mass Communication from the same university. He has also appeared in a number of TV shows including Korean dramas (soap operas) and entertainment shows, gaining favorable response from the public. Sung enlisted in the Republic of Korea Army in 2008 and was honorably discharged in 2010. Sung's first comeback concert after the discharge attracted more than 6,000 fans from all over the country.
Music career
While at Korea University, Sung participated in an online singing competition and was awarded 1st place in the country. The winners of the song festival released a compilation album, from which his song “The Road that Leads to Me” became a major hit. Due to the popularity of the song, the compilation album sold nearly 100,000 copies, even though it was a promotional album. This helped Sung to attain stardom in November 2000.
Sung’s official debut was in 2001 when he released his first album, 처음처럼 (Like the First Time). Mainly consisting of ballads, his debut album contained three hits and made him the best newcomer singer of the year. Participating as a guest singer on You Hee-yeol’s album also contributed to his rising popularity. His second album released in 2002 was also a success, selling more than 650,000 copies. He continued to release album after album, averaging about one a year.
Sung currently has released 7 full albums - 5 are traditional ballad/pop albums, a "remake" album and a "special" album called "Try to Remember." He also released a "Best of" album in Japan which included his first Japanese title. His sixth and final pre-army was released in 2008.
in September 2011, he made his comeback to the music industry with his seventh album. The album's title song "The First Time" is a sweet and delicate ballad that was also released earlier in the year as a digital single. He decided to produce and release a regular album instead of a mini or a single to express his appreciation for his fans that had waited so long.
The album consists of 12 songs composed by singer-songwriters Yoon Sang, Kim Hyun-hhul and Kang Seung-won. It also features a duet with Lena Park and IU. Also included is the Secret Garden OST theme song, "You're My Spring".
Sung's comeback track "난 좋아" (Even Now) released on his 7th album debuted at number 5 on Billboard's Korea K-Pop Hot 100 for the week of 22 September.

The arghul (Arabic: أرغول‎ or يرغول‎‎), also spelled argul, arghoul, arghool, argol, or yarghul (Israel), is a traditional Egyptian musical instrument. It has been used since Ancient Egyptian times and is still used as a traditional instrument in Egypt.

Basic Characteristics

(From Edward William Lane's An Account of the Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians.)
Modern Arghul, 3 ft. 2½ in. long.

The arghul is a double-pipe, single-reed woodwind instrument that consists of two tubes: a melody pipe with between five and seven holes and a longer drone (Arabic ardiyya, "ground") pipe. Its tone is similar to that of a clarinet, although a bit more reed like. Unlike the similar mijwiz, the arghul only has fingering holes on one of the instrument's pipes (the melody pipe), and the drone pipe has a detachable length that allows the player to alter the pitch of the drone.
In the illustration above all three lengths are shown in use. An arghoul belonging to the collection of the Conservatoire Royal at Brussels, described by Victor Mahillon in his catalogue (No. 113), gives the following scale: —
Arghuls are in Egypt and other Arab nations as an accompaniment to belly dancing and other types of Arabic musical performances. Circular breathing is an important part of the playing of the instrument.
There are three varieties of arghuls: The small arghul (arghoul alasghar), the medium arghul (arghoul alsoghayr), and the large arghul (arghoul alkebir).
Çifte
Çifte is a Turkish folk instrument of the wind type. It is made by tying two reed pipes side by side. Two small reed pieces which produce the sound are added to the ends of both reeds. These two small reeds are taken into the mouth cavity and it is played by blowing the air into both at the same time.
There are two çifte types known as Demli Çifte and Demsiz Çifte. In demli çifte one of the reeds does not have any pitch keys and it just produces a background sound. There are melody keys on the other reed and the main melody is played through them
Çifte is also known as Argun, Argul, Kargın or Zambır at different regions.
In Turkish, the word "çifte" also refers to a double-barreled shotgun, no doubt because of the barrels' resemblance to the wind instrument.
Dozaleh
The dozaleh [dozAle] is one of the old folk wind instruments of Iran which is used in mirth celebrations. Abu Nasr Farabi had called it Mezmarol-Mosana or Mozdavadg [mozdavej] ("married"). The dozaleh has a sound like Neyanban [neianbAn] (bagpipe), but to some extent more clear and lower. It is played in Khorasan [xorAsAn], Kermanshah [KermAnSAh], and mostly in Iran. In some different dialects it is called Zanbooreh [zanbureh].

It has a morphological classification of SAB(r)c, which indicates it is a barred spiral with an inner ring and loosely wound arms. This is a borderline, low-luminosity Seyfert galaxy with an active nucleus. However, no radio or X-ray emission has been detected from the core, and it may only have a small supermassive black hole with less than a million times the mass of the Sun.

Yoshida Castle (吉田城, Yoshida-jō) is a Japanese castle located in Toyohashi, southeastern Aichi Prefecture, Japan. At the end of the Edo period, Yoshida Castle was home to the Inaba clan, daimyō of Tateyama Domain. The castle was also known as Imahashi Castle (今橋城, Imahashi-jō ), and later as Toyohashi Castle.

Description
Yoshida Castle is a flat-land style Japanese castle, built on the west bank of the Toyogawa (river). The main bailey was enclosed by a moat, with three three-story yagura, one two-story yagura and three gates. The second and third baileys were also moated, and had smaller yagura and fortified gates. Aside from some remnants of the stonework on the moats, nothing remains of the original structures. The present “castle” is a modern reconstruction of one of the three-story yagura. It houses a small museum with articles pertaining to local history.
History
A castle was built on the banks of the Toyogawa (river) in 1505 by Makino Kohaku, a retainer of Imagawa Ujichika to secure his foothold on eastern Mikawa Province against the growing power of the Matsudaira clan in western Mikawa Province. Due to its strategic location on a river crossing, the castle was involved in numerous battles during the Sengoku period, changing hands several times and was destroyed and rebuilt on several occasions. From 1565, the castle came under the control of Tokugawa Ieyasu, who named Sakai Tadatsugu as castellan.
Following the Battle of Odawara in 1590, Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered the Tokugawa clan to relocate to the Kantō region and assigned the castle to Ikeda Terumasa. Ikeda developed the surrounding castle town and embarked on a massive and ambitious plan to rebuild Yoshida Castle. However, following the Battle of Sekigahara, he was relocated to Himeji Castle. Construction of the castle was incomplete, and the central keep was never built.
After the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, Yoshida Castle became the center of Yoshida Domain, a feudal domain, which occupied a strategic position on the Tōkaidō (road) between Edo and Nagoya. The domain was assigned to several different fudai daimyō clans untl the Matsudaira (Nagasawa-Ōkōchi) clan took possession in 1752, which remained in residence at Yoshida until the Meiji Restoration. The final daimyō of Yoshida, Matsudaira Nobuhisa, surrendered the castle without resistance to the Meiji government in 1868. The castle was turned over to the fledgling Imperial Japanese Army in 1871, but largely was destroyed in a fire in 1873. Much of the castle grounds remained in the hands of the military (as the garrison of the IJA 18th Infantry Regiment) until the end of World War II.
Following the end of the war, a portion of the Third Bailey was transformed into Toyohashi Park, and the modern Toyohashi City Hall was constructed on another portion. In 1954, a three-story yagura, the Kurogane Yagura (黒金櫓) was reconstructed out of reinforced concrete. An art museum and sports facilities were later erected on the site of the Inner Baileys. The stonework was extensively repaired in 2005.

América Futebol Clube, or América (or América de Natal), as they are usually called, is a traditional Brazilian football team from Natal in Rio Grande do Norte, founded on July 14, 1915.
América is the only Potiguar club that have won an interstate tournament. The team won Campeonato do Nordeste (Brazilian Northeast Championship) in 1998, defeating Esporte Clube Vitória by a 3-1 score in the final match. It is the only Football Team in Rio Grande do Norte to obtain titles outside the state as in 1973, became the undefeated winner of Taça Almir de Albuquerque, which involved teams from North-Northeast of Brazil and is the only club from Rio Grande do Norte to participate in an international championship, the Copa Conmebol in 1998.
América's greatest rival is ABC, also from Natal.

History
The team was founded on July 14, 1915. The first official match played in the state of Rio Grande do Norte was América 3-0 ABC, on June 22, 1919 valid for the first Campeonato Potiguar de Futebol, organized at that time by the Liga de Desportos Terrestres. The club's first title came in 1919. The club won the Liga de Desportos Terrestres, defeating Centro Esportivo Natalense and ABC, becoming the first Campeonato Potiguar champions.
On November 7, 1928, through Law 707 the club was the first to be recognized as a State Public Utility instrument.
América had been licensed team of the Federação Norteriograndense de Futebol (FNF) for 5 years, between 1960 and 1965, thus the team did not participate in official competitions. Instead, the team committed to the construction of its official ground at Rodrigues Alves Avenue, bourough of Tirol, Natal.
In 1974 América was crowned undefeated state champions, playing 20 matches with 12 wins and 8 ties. In 1975, América won the Torneio Norte-Nordeste. Between 1987 and 1992, América won 5 state championships, only losing in 1990.
In 1996, the team from Rio Grande do Norte was runner-up of the Brazilian Championship Second Division and became eligible to participate in the First Division in the following year. In its return to the main division, América ended in 17th place, ahead of other powerful teams, such as Corinthians and Fluminense. In 1998, however, the club failed to remain in the First Division. In 1998, América achieved its greatest glory, becoming champions of Campeonato do Nordeste, defeating Vitória-BAin the final match on July 4, 3-1, with goals from Biro-Biro, Paulinho Kobayashi and Carioca. América's team at that time consisted of the following players: Gabriel; Gilson, Paulo Roberto (André), Lima and Rogerinho; Montanha, Carioca, Biro-Biro and Moura; Paulinho Kobayashi and Leonardo (Vanderlei).
In October, 2003 the city counsellor Hermano Morais published in the Diário Oficial do Município, the Law n° 5.493, recognizing América Futebol Clube, as an instrument of the City's Public Utility.
In 2005, the club was promoted to the Campeonato Brasileiro Second Division, after finishing in second in the third division. América had the best forward of the competition, Paulinho Marília, who scored 10 goals.
On November 25, 2006, América once again managed to qualify for the Brazilian Championship First Division, after a 2-2 tie with champions Atlético-MG, at Mineirão, with a record crowd of 74,694 (largest crowd of the year in Brazil), fighting back after conceding two early goals. At the end of the game, América crossed the stadium applauded by Atlético's fans. The club finished in fourth in the Campeonato Brasileiro Second Division.
In the following year, América was relegated after a disastrous performance in the Série A, obtaining only 17 points out of 114 possible points, and finishing the championship 24 points behind the second-to-last placed team, Paraná, in which, to date is the worst campaign of a team in the Série A since 2003, when the round-robin format was established. After two seasons struggling against relegation in the Série B, América eventually was relegated to the Série C in 2010, but gained promotion to the Série B again in 2011.

ReferencesCommittee on Sustainability Assessment (COSA) is a non-profit global consortium of institutions, sustained in partnership with the International Institute for Sustainable Development’s Sustainable Commodity Initiative, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), and the United Nations International Trade Centre (ITC). COSA is a volunteer-driven organization using participatory methods to pioneer the scientific measurement of sustainability in agriculture.
The focus of the COSA initiative is developing and applying independent measurement tools and indicators to assess the distinct social, environmental and economic impacts of agricultural practices. One of its key objectives is a common and consistently comparable set of global indicators suitable for farmers, policy-makers, and industry to better evaluate the extent to which their work in agriculture is sustainable, and ultimately to improve their sustainability. COSA’s robust methodology can provide rigorous yet accessible impact assessments that are consistent and recognized by leading institutions globally.
COSA partners in developing countries are trained in the methods to collect empirical data used to assess the basic ecological, economic, and social effects of agricultural practices. COSA is also used in development projects, private supply chains, and with sustainability labels such as fair trade, organic, UTZ Certified, and Rainforest Alliance. As of 2010 COSA is being applied in: Colombia, Costa Rica, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guatemala, Honduras, Peru, Tanzania, and Vietnam. It has been applied in other countries in the past during the pilot testing.

Background
Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 81, commonly abbreviated to Jasta 81, was a World War I "hunting group" (i.e., fighter squadron) of the Luftstreitkräfte, forerunner to the Luftwaffe. The squadron would score six or more aerial victories during July/August 1917, while serving on the Eastern Front. After switching to the Western Front, Jasta 81 would score another 35 victories from May 1918 to war's end. The unit's victories came at the expense of five killed in action, three killed in flying accidents, one injured in a flying accident, three wounded in action, and three taken prisoner of war.
History
Jasta 81 originated in Jagdflieger Ober-Ost, which was founded at Brest-Litovsk on 16 June 1917. It was intended for service on the Eastern Front. In August 1917, it was assigned to 8 Armee. In early May 1918, it was incorporated into Jagdgruppe 5. On 30 May 1918, it was revamped as Jasta 81. At this time, the squadron was posted to 7 Armee on the Western Front in France. On 27 June 1918, it was switched over to Jagdgruppe 4; in late July, it would return to JG 5. In late September 1918, the jasta would be assigned to 3 Armee.

Microhylidae, commonly known as narrow-mouthed frogs, is a geographically widespread family of frogs. The 495 species are in 68 genera and 9 subfamilies, which is the largest number of genera of any frog family.

Description
As suggested by their name, microhylids are mostly small frogs. Many species are below 1.5 cm (0.59 in) in length, although some species are as large as 9 cm (3.5 in). They can be arboreal or terrestrial, and some will even live close to water. The ground-dwellers are often found under leaf litter within forests, occasionally venturing out at night to hunt. The two main shapes for the microhylids are wide bodies and narrow mouths and normal frog proportions. Those with narrow mouths generally eat termites and ants, and the others have diets typical of most frogs. The species of the genus Breviceps are burrowing frogs found in the arid regions of Africa. Some of these species will even lay their eggs under ground.
Reproduction
The microhylids of New Guinea and Australia completely bypass the tadpole stage, with direct development from egg to frog. The arboreal species can therefore lay the eggs within the trees, and never need venture to the ground. Where species do have tadpoles, these almost always lack the teeth or horny beaks typical of the tadpoles of other families.
Anatomy
The skull has paired palatines and frontoparietals. The facial nerve passes through the anterior acoustic foramen in the auditory capsule; the trigeminal and facial nerve ganglia are fused to form a prootic ganglion. The eight (or seven) presacral holochordal vertebrae are all precoelous except for a biconcave surface on last presacral. The pectoral girdle is firmisternal and some show reduced clavicle and procoracoids. The terminal phalanges are blunt, pointed, or T-shaped. The tadpole lacks keratinized mouth parts and has a large spiracular chamber emptied by a caudomedial spiracle.
Range
Frogs from Microhylidae occur throughout the tropical and warm temperate regions of North America, South America, Africa, eastern India, Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, through New Guinea and Australia. Although most are found in tropical or subtropical regions, a few species can be found in arid or nontropical areas. They are the majority frog species in New Guinea and Madagascar.

Climate
Wakkanai has the typical humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb) of Hokkaido, with cold winters, warm summers and generally heavy precipitation from the Aleutian Low, whose winds hit the city direct from the Sea of Japan. The mean annual temperature, at 6.5 °C (43.7 °F), is the second lowest for a significant population centre in Japan after Nemuro. Snowfall at 6.6 metres (260 in), the third highest for a big city in Japan after Asahikawa and Aomori and one of the highest anywhere in the world. For comparison, Nain in Canada receives 194 inches (4.9 m) of snow.
The Aleutian Low also makes the sunshine hours the lowest of Japan’s major population centres and in the winter the wind speeds are the highest in Japan with an average of 20.2 km/h (12.6 mph), which adds to the −4.7 °C (23.5 °F) cold of a typical winter day. The city's port is usually usable throughout the year, but does occasionally freeze in cold winters.

The Girl Scout National Center West was located just outside Ten Sleep, Wyoming, among the Big Horn Mountains, near the entrance to Ten Sleep Canyon. A portion of the center was one of the largest encampments in the world at 15,400 acres (62 km2) (14,600 acres (59 km2) also reported) of rugged wilderness near the entrance to Ten Sleep Canyon near the Bighorn National Forest. 640 acres (2.6 km2) of those acres were donated by the United States government.

History
The single largest land acquisition in Girl Scouts of the USA history, the center was purchased in 1968. Girl Scouts and Girl Guides from all over the world engaged in outdoor activities including horseback riding, backpacking, fishing, orienteering, exploring Native American pictographs and study of geology. Sample programs that were offered included Hike-A-Peak, a 19-day backpacking event for girls 16-18 years old; Tote 'N Trek, a 9-day backpacking excursion for novice backpackers ages 14-18; Saddle Straddle, a 6-day pack trip for experienced riders; and Paint the West, focusing on arts skills and exploring western art. The site also supported Wider Opportunities, family camping, and camping for troops traveling to other destinations.
In 1978, Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom filmed part of its show at the National Center West, featuring wildlife projects made by Girl Scouts.
Closure
Because of high maintenance costs, the center was closed in 1989; the land was sold in 1991. A part of the site is now owned and operated by The Nature Conservancy as the 9,851 acres (39.87 km2) Tensleep Preserve, with facilities for workshops and seminars. The remaining 4,749 acres (19.22 km2) are part of the Clay Ranch.

The NZH Public Transport Museum (Dutch: NZH Vervoer Museum) is a museum in Haarlem, Netherlands, dedicated to promoting interest and conserving the bus and tram cultural heritage of Kennemerland. It is located behind the former bus depot of the "Noord-Zuid-Hollandsche Stoomtramweg-Maatschappij" (NZH), a bus and tram company.

History

The museum was opened in 1996 and aims to conserve the cultural heritage of the old tramway lines in the region, located on the historic tram depot of the Eerste Nederlandsche Electrische Tram-Maatschappij, built in 1899, which later in 1904 became the tram depot of the Electrische Spoorweg-Maatschappij (ESM), and still later the bus depot of the NZH. The tram line Amsterdam – Haarlem – Zandvoort ran until August 31, 1957, when trams were replaced by buses. The bus depot closed in 2006, but the museum is located on a small piece of land still owned by the NZH at the back.
A327

The most famous "Blue Tram" is the A327, owned by the Tramweg-Stichting. The tram was built in 1913 by the Haarlem carriage factory Beijnes in Haarlem. It was in use until 1948 in Haarlem and after that until 1960 in Leiden. Together with the tram B26, in 1961 it was almost scrapped like many others before them, but was saved by the historical society NVBS. In 1965 it was handed over to the newly formed Tramweg-Stichting, who restored it. Since 1981 it is a working museum tram.
The museum is kept open by a large group of volunteers who actively work on the collection. Contact information is available on the website.
The museum is open Mondays and Thursdays from 9-12, and Saturdays from 11:00 to 16:00. Admission is free. There are restrooms and parking is available in front of the museum at the former bus depot parking lot.

Pedogenesis (from the Greek pedo-, or pedon, meaning 'soil, earth,' and genesis, meaning 'origin, birth') is the science and study of the processes that lead to the formation of soil (soil evolution) and first explored by the Russian geologist Vasily Dokuchaev (1846 – 1903), the so-called grandfather of soil science, who determined in 1883 that soil formed over time as a consequence of climatic, mineral and biological processes, which he demonstrated using the soil forming equation:
Soil = f(C, PM, O) × time
(where C = climate, PM = parent material, O = biological processes)
In 1941, the Swiss scientist Hans Jenny expanded Vasily Dokuchaev equation by adding topographic relief as a factor and separating the biological processes into the fauna and flora coming up with the equation:
Soil = f(C, PM, R, O, V) × time
(where C = climate, PM = parent material, R = relief/topology, O = fauna, V = flora)
Pedogenesis is a branch of pedology, whose other aspects include the soil morphology, classification (taxonomy) of soils, and their distribution in nature, present and past (soil geography and paleopedology).

Climate
Climate regulates soil formation. Soils are more developed in areas with higher rainfall and more warmth. The rate of chemical weathering increases by 2-3 times when the temperature increases by 10 degrees Celsius. Climate also affects which organisms are present, affecting the soil chemically and physically (movement of roots).
Organisms
The organisms living in and on the soil form distinct soil types. Coniferous forests have acidic leaf litter that form soils classed as inceptisols. Mixed or deciduous forests leave a larger layer of humus, changing the elements that are either leeched or accumulated in the soil, and thereby forming soils classed as alfisols. Prairies have very high humus accumulation, creating a dark, thick A horizon characteristic of mollisols.
For example, three species of land snails in the genus Euchondrus in the Negev desert are noted for eating lichens growing under the surface limestone rocks and slabs (endolithic lichens). They disrupt and eat the limestone. Their grazing results in the weathering of the stones, and the subsequent formation of soil. They have a significant effect on the region: the total population of snails is estimated to process between 0.7 and 1.1 metric ton per hectare per year of limestone in the Negev desert.
Parent material
The rock from which soil is formed is called parent material. The main types are: aeolian sediments, glacial till, glacial outwash, alluvium, lacustrine sediments and residual parent material (coral or bedrock).
Pedologists see soil formation or soil properties as a function of regional climate, biota, topography, parent material, time and other variables.
Examples
A variety of mechanisms contribute to soil formation, including siltation, erosion, overpressure and lakebed succession. A specific example of the evolution of soils in prehistoric lake beds is in the Makgadikgadi Pans of the Kalahari Desert, where change in an ancient river course led to millennia of salinity buildup and formation of calcretes and silcretes.

A top kill is a procedure used as a means of regaining control over an oil well that is experiencing an uncontrolled eruption of crude oil or natural gas (blowout). The process involves pumping heavyweight drilling mud into the well. This procedure is expected to stop the flow of oil and gas from the well. A further step could be sealing the well completely, often with cement.
In use
The top kill procedure was used to plug flaming oil wells, blown up by retreating Iraqi forces, in 1991, during the Gulf War.
This technique came to prominence during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill when it was used in an attempt to seal a seafloor oil well after the failure of the blowout preventer. However, it failed to block the flow of oil.

Claudio Sánchez-Albornoz y Menduiña (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈklauðjo ˈsantʃeθ alˈβornoθ]; Madrid April 7, 1893 – Ávila July 8, 1984) was an eminent Spanish medieval historian, statesman, and president of the Spanish Republican government in Exile during the rule of Francisco Franco.

Education and early career
Sánchez-Albornoz was born in Madrid to a prominent political family from the provincial capital of Ávila and attended the Central University of Madrid, where he obtained a licentiate degree in letters and philosophy in 1913 with first class honors. One year later, at age 21, he was awarded a doctorate degree in history with a thesis entitled "La Monarquía en Asturias, León y Castilla durante los siglos VIII al XIII. La Potestad Real y los Señoríos". He quickly established himself as the country's preeminent young scholar of medieval Spanish history, particularly the history of the monarchy and royal institutions in the early Middle Ages.
By 1920, Sánchez-Albornoz had already held several prestigious university chairs when he was offered the chair in Spanish medieval history at Madrid held by his late thesis adviser, Eduardo de Hinojosa. In 1926, he was inducted into the Real Academia de la Historia—the youngest member up to that time ever admitted to the elite scholarly institution. By 1931, he was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters and served as rector of the Central University the following year. During this time, he took a hiatus from his academic pursuits to join the newly established republican government, serving in parliament as a representative from Ávila, and later in several other prominent posts, including Minister of Education.
Exile and later career
During the early years of the Spanish Civil War, Sánchez-Albornoz was appointed the Spanish Republic ambassador to Portugal. When the government in Lisbon declared its support for Francisco Franco, he was dismissed from his post and he fled with his family to France and then, in 1940, to Argentina, where he would spend more than four decades in exile as both a scholar and leader of the democratic anti-Franco movement abroad.
After a brief post at the University of Cuyo in the northern province of Mendoza, Sánchez-Albornoz was offered a position at the University of Buenos Aires where he created a center for Iberian medieval studies and founded a historical journal, the Cuadernos de historia de España. During these years, he remained a tremendously productive scholar, writing extensively on early Spanish history and training young Argentine and other Latin American scholars to work on medieval documents and legal texts.
For Sánchez-Albornoz, the work of recovering the roots of the Spanish character and its political institutions in the Middle Ages was an extension of his political commitments to the republican Spanish state he had been a part of in the 1930s. Between 1962 and 1970, Sánchez-Albornoz served as president of the council of the Spanish Republican Government in Exile and used his reputation and numerous invitations to speak abroad as a platform to promote the restoration of democracy in Spain. Even when Franco extended an amnesty to regime critics in 1969, Sánchez-Albornoz refused to return until the dictator had died.
Sánchez-Albornoz's scholarship came to focus on the kingdoms of Castile and León and the evolution of social and economic institutions under the influence of external pressures, whether Germanic (Visigothic) or Muslim/Arab. In his monumental, three-volume history of early feudalism that he had begun composing in France before the outbreak of war, En torno a los origines del feudalismo (1942), Sánchez-Albornoz emphasized the contributions of Visigothic culture and legal institutions to early Spanish history, particularly the monarchy and its relationship to the nobility and other segments of society. He also emphasized the emergence in Spain of a free peasantry in advancing the frontier regions during the Reconquista that complicated the development of serfdom and hierarchical structures of lordship historians described elsewhere in feudal Europe. While an earlier generation of scholars had also tended to focus on questions about the continuity of Roman influences in medieval Iberia, Sánchez-Albornoz instead argued that the Visigothic invasions of the fifth century had created a new, uniquely Hispanic, civilization which defined Spanish history and the Spanish people from that point forward, even during the centuries of Arab occupation.
Dispute with Américo Castro
This conviction about the origins of a unique Spanish national identity led to a notable academic feud with another scholar in exile, Américo Castro, who had moved to the United States and taught at Princeton University. Castro's path-breaking book, España en su historia (1948; Engl. trans. 1954) posited that "Spanish" culture was essentially a hybrid one, produced over the course of centuries by the intermixing of Christian, Muslim and Jewish populations and traditions. Castro coined the term "convivencia"—loosely translated as "living-together-ness" or "cohabitation"—to describe the multicultural, religiously tolerant and dynamic society of medieval Spain. Sánchez-Albornoz—who regarded Castro's interdisciplinary, literature-focused methodology as insufficiently rigorous and scholarly—responded with a new study, España: una enigma histórico (1956), that argued for the persistence of a pre-Arab invasion Spanish culture and national identity grounded in the reproduction of key legal, political, and economic institutions. While he did not deny that Muslims and Jews were an important presence in medieval Iberia, Sánchez-Albornoz maintained that they contributed little creative energy to the processes of history or state-building and insisted upon an enduring idea of Spanish nationhood and identity that transcended the vagaries of history and the temporary influence of outside groups.
While few academic historians today still subscribe to Sanchez-Albornoz's ideas about an essential national Spanish "character" which motivates history, there is still a lively scholarly debate over convivencia as a historical model for understanding medieval Spain.
Return to Spain
In April 1976, six months after the death of Franco, Sánchez-Albornoz returned to his homeland for the first time in more than forty years and was given a hero's welcome, particularly in his family town of Ávila. He returned to Buenos Aires after a brief stay, but moved back to Ávila permanently in July 1983. He died one year later, on 8 July 1984 at the age of 91 and was buried in the Cathedral of Ávila. The Fundación D. Claudio Sánchez-Albornoz [1] in Ávila was established shortly after his death to preserve and promote his scholarly legacy.
During his long and distinguished career, Sánchez-Albornoz received dozens of awards and honorary degrees from institutions and nations around the world and was a member, or corresponding member, of numerous scholarly academies.[2]
Sánchez-Albornoz was survived by two daughters, and a son, Nicolás (born 1926), who went on to become a noted scholar of Latin American demographic history, author of La población de América Latina (1973, trans 1974, frequently republished).

ReferencesCampus Manitoba (CMB) is a consortium of Manitoba's public post-secondary institutions intended to reduce barriers and enable the achievement of educational goals for Manitoba's student population.
CMB serves as a conduit that provides access to online college and university courses for public post-secondary students currently admitted to one of seven partner institutions. Courses are developed and offered by Assiniboine Community College, Brandon University, Red River College, Université de Saint-Boniface, University College of the North, University of Manitoba, and University of Winnipeg. CMB's admin office is located at Brandon University and consists of staff members who provide academic and logistical support for Manitoba's post-secondary students.
On July 17th, 2014, the Government of Manitoba officially announced the launch of the new CMB website and a commitment to online education in Manitoba. Through its website, eCampus Manitoba (eCMB), CMB helps students of seven public post-secondary institutions in Manitoba browse and request permission to take courses from universities or colleges in Manitoba other than their own. After following the correct procedure and consulting an academic advisor, students can enroll in the course and receive credit at their own institution for completing the coursework.
In addition to maintaining eCMB and servicing Manitoba's post-secondary students, CMB has been tasked with "developing an online credit transfer system that will help students transition between institutions, from college to university or vice versa, without losing credits or repeating similar courses." In fall of 2014, Manitoba's NDP government's throne speech reconfirmed its commitment to "launch a new Credit Transfer Portal to help students move more easily between programs and institutions."
On April 26th, 2013, the Government of Manitoba announced that CMB's services would be offered exclusively online due to decreasing enrollment in the programs at rural CMB offices. Previously, CMB consisted of centres located in rural Manitoban communities. These offices were staffed by CMB coordinators who provided academic and logistical support for students enrolled in distance courses through CMB. The centres were located in Altona, Boissevain, Brandon, Carman, Crosslake, Dauphin, Eriksdale, Flin Flon, Killarney, Portage La Prairie, Steinbach, Swan River, The Pas, Thompson in Manitoba and at Whitebear in Saskatchewan.

Kelly is an English-language unisex given name, derived from the Irish surname Kelly.
It has predominantly been used as a feminine given name, with a significant minority usage as a masculine name; during the peak of the name's popularity in the United States during the 1960s to 1970s, feminine usage was about four to five times as frequent as masculine usage.

Etymology

The surname Kelly has multiple origins. There is a Clan Kelly in Scotland, possibly derived from a toponym Kelloe. The Irish surname may be from either Ó Ceallaigh or Ó Cadhla, or yet again from a toponym such as Kelly, near Arbroath or Kellie, in Fife. The surname was established in the United States by the early 19th century, and it began to be used as a masculine name in the later 19th century. Feminine usage first appears in the 1940s, and surpasses masculine usage in 1957.
Its from the irish name Cellach. St. Cellach of Armagh, venerated in the Roman Catholic Church as Saint Cellach.
Popularity
According to the U.S. Social Security Administration, Kelly, as a girl's name, was ranked #900 in 1950, then steadily gained popularity until 1977 (peaking at rank #10); Kelly, as a boy's name, was consistently in the top 800 (but never the top 300) from 1881 to 1939, then steadily gained popularity until 1968 (peaking at rank #97). The girl's name reached two significant peaks, rank #12 in 1968, then declining to rank #23 in 1972, and again rising to rank #10 in 1977; both the girl's and the boy's name have been in steady decline since reaching their respective popularity peaks; the boy's name fell below rank #1000 in 2003; the girl's name lingers at rank #367 as of 2013. 
In the United Kingdom, it made its way into the top 50 during the 1970s and by 1984 was the 15th most popular female first name. However, 10 years later it had declined to 53rd place and by 1999 had fallen out of the top 100.

Texas Gulf Coast Regional Airport (IATA: LJN, ICAO: KLBX, FAA LID: LBX), previously known as Brazoria County Airport, is a county-owned public-use airport located four miles (6 km) southwest of the central business district of Angleton and north of Lake Jackson, both cities in Brazoria County, Texas, United States.
Although most U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, Brazoria County Airport is assigned LBX by the FAA and LJN by the IATA (which assigned LBX to Lubang Airport in the Philippines).
On March 24, 2010, the Brazoria County Commissioners' Court voted to change the name of the airport to Texas Gulf Coast Regional Airport, effective October 1, 2010.

Facilities and aircraft
Texas Gulf Coast Regional Airport covers an area of 674 acres (273 ha) which contains one concrete paved runway (17/35) measuring 7,000 x 100 ft (2,134 x 30 m). For the 12-month period ending July 31, 2006, the airport had 60,000 aircraft operations, an average of 164 per day: 97% general aviation, 3% air taxi and 1% military. There are 92 aircraft based at this airport: 77% single-engine, 8% multi-engine, 7% jet and 9% helicopter.
The airport's runway was closed in December 2009 for a major reconstruction project, in which the runway's former asphalt surface was replaced with concrete. During the runway closure, aircraft temporarily used the airport's main taxiway for takeoffs and landings. Larger aircraft, such as the Aerodynamics (ADI) Dynajet Airbus ACJ (A319) operated as a shuttle service for Dow Chemical, were diverted to William P. Hobby Airport in Houston during the runway closure. The runway reconstruction project was completed in July 2010, and the airport became fully operational once again.
Bristow U.S. LLC, which is one of the largest Part 135 commercial helicopter operators in the world, currently operates a base at the airport serving the offshore oil and gas industry in the nearby Gulf of Mexico. Turbine powered helicopter types operated by Bristow from LBX include the Bell 206L-4 "Long Ranger IV", Bell 407, Eurocopter EC 135 and Sikorsky S-76C+. Bristow U.S. is part of the Bristow Group.
The airport's on-site restaurant, the Windsock Restaurant, closed in February 2011. Following renovations, the building was reopened as the Crosswind Cafe in December 2011.
Airline History
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Texas Gulf Coast Regional Airport was linked to the national airway grid with regularly scheduled airline service. Among some of the more unusual routes were nonstop flights to Victoria, Texas and the Clear Lake City STOLport [1] which were served as extensions or as an intermediate stop on the regularly scheduled passenger route between then-named Brazoria County Airport and Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH) as this airport was called prior to airline deregulation. In the 1980s, the old Lake Jackson Dow Airport (LJN)  near Lake Jackson's town center was closed following the construction and opening of the new Brazoria County Airport north of the city limits of Lake Jackson. Prior to the opening of the present airport, in February 1976 Houston Metro Airlines was operating six nonstop flights every weekday from the old airport (LJN) to Houston (IAH) with de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter STOL turboprops as well as two nonstop flights every weekday from LJN to Victoria (VCT), also with Twin Otters. The old Lake Jackson Dow Airport was also the site of an emergency landing of a hijacked National Airlines (NA) Boeing 727-200 jetliner which was followed by a short standoff by the hijackers with law enforcement personnel on July 12, 1972.[2].
Following the opening of the Brazoria County Airport (LBX), Metro Airlines, which by then had changed its name from Houston Metro Airlines, occasionally used larger, flight attendant staffed Short 330 commuter airliner turboprops in addition to the smaller de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter STOL turboprops on flights to and from Houston Intercontinental (IAH). In April 1981, Metro Airlines was operating six nonstop DHC-6 Twin Otter flights every weekday from the new LBX airport to IAH. Other regional aircraft serving LBX in scheduled airline service included Royale Airlines Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante turboprops as well as Beechcraft Model 99 turboprops. Royale, which had taken over the service at LBX from Metro Airlines, functioned as a feeder airline for Continental Airlines to and from IAH prior to Royale's bankruptcy and subsequent cessation of all flight operations. Several other small commuter air carriers served the airport as well over the years. In 1971, Amistad Airlines was operating turboprop service from the old Lake Jackson Dow Airport (LJN) to both Houston Hobby Airport (HOU) and to Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH). In 1985, Texas Airlines operated service to Houston Intercontinental which were flown with Piper prop aircraft.
Other air carriers that have served Texas Gulf Coast Regional Airport in the past include Comair operating Canadair CRJ regional jet aircraft and Aerodynamics Inc. (ADI) flying Fokker F28 Fellowship jets and Airbus A319 jetliners.[3] Both of these air carriers were operating scheduled corporate charters via respective contracts for Dow Chemical shuttling employees to and from Dow Chemical's Midland Michigan facilities.
Currently, Dow Chemical operates two corporate-owned Bombardier (Canadair) CRJ-700 aircraft from the airport flying its employees to and from MBS International Airport in Freeland, Michigan and also to Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport in Louisiana.
At present, no regularly scheduled commercial passenger airline service is offered from this airfield.

Michael Turner (born 1934) is a British illustrator who specialises in motoring and aviation paintings. He is regarded as one of the early examples of such type and is one of the most highly regarded of all. Turner counts racing drivers, teams, sponsors, pilots, motor and aircraft manufacturers, R.A.F. (Royal Air Force) and Army messes, museums and private collections as his client lists and has hosted a number of solo shows all over the world, plus other specialist shows.

Biography
Turner was born and raised within the suburbs of Harrow, Middlesex. During the Second World War, he became interested in aviation and those aeroplanes of the Royal Air Force and drew aircraft in his school exercise books which infuriated his teachers. After the war, Turner developed an interest in motoring and motorsport when during his family holiday to the Isle of Man in 1947, they attended the British Empire Trophy Race.
After leaving school, Turner attended an art college, followed by his time at the national service with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers for two years. His first job after the national service was for a London advertising studios and turned freelance in 1957. Turner’s artworks was shown regularly on the wall of the renowned Steering Wheel Club in London and many of these appeared on numerous magazine and book covers.
In the 1960s, Turner started up his own company, 'Studio 88', to publish his aviation and motor racing prints, as well as his annual set of Christmas Cards that later became popular with enthusiasts. He was commissioned by organisers to create official posters for notable motorsport events such as 24 hours of Le Mans, 12 hours of Sebring, a number of Formula One races and many others that took place in notable circuits such as Nürburgring. He was notable in the United States for his poster works for races that took places in Watkins Glen between 1969 to 1980 and also created posters for its United States Grand Prix East races.
With a need to capture the genuine nature of being in an event, Turner tends to travel to as many motorsport and aviation events as he could where he commonly sketches at events he attends for reference reasons.
Turner was also involved with the Can-Am series and had close ties with the McLaren team, which he became friends with its drivers, Denny Hulme and Bruce McLaren. He was responsible of the design of the bodywork of the race winning McLaren M1B and designed the team logo as well as designed the colour scheme for its first Formula One car of the 1966 season. That colour scheme was short lived as prior to the Monaco Grand Prix, the car’s colour scheme had to be changed when it was chosen by the producers of the film Grand Prix to the lead car of the 'Yamura' team, driven by its lead character, Pete Aron (played by James Garner), the colour scheme was changed to team’s white and blue, resembling that of Honda.
He is a founder member of The Guild of Aviation Artists, which he has been Chairman on two occasions and is currently President, and is also a Honorary Fellow of the Guild of Motoring Artists.
Turner has involvements with the Red Arrows, which he has flown with them in the past. He counts racing drivers, teams, sponsors, pilots, motor and aircraft manufacturers, R.A.F. and Army messes, museums and private collections as his client lists and has hosted a number of solo shows all over the world, plus other specialist shows. His artwork has also graced the packaging of Airfix models. Turner have had to this date, six books of his works published.
Personal life
Turner has been married to his wife Helen since 1960. They have two daughters, Alison and Suzanne, his son, Graham is also an artist following the footstep of his father, they continues to visit several Grand Prix each year. Turner is licensed to fly a private aircraft, which he flies his privately owned Chipmunk aircraft in his spare time.
Michael and his son have held exhibition of their artworks at Halton House in 2005 and 2006.

The Schomburgk's deer (Rucervus schomburgki) was a member of the family Cervidae. Native to Central Thailand, Schomburgk's deer was described by Edward Blyth in 1863 and named after Sir Robert H. Schomburgk, who was the British consul in Bangkok from 1857-1864. It is thought to have gone extinct by 1938, but there is speculation that the deer might still be extant.

Description


This deer was a graceful species similar in appearance to the barasingha. The pelt was a dark brown with lighter underparts. The underside of the tail was white. Males possessed basket-like antlers, upon which all the main tines branched. This caused the deer to have up to 33 points on their antlers and the outer edge of the rack to be up to 35 inches long. Females had no antlers.
Habitat
Schomburgk's deer inhabited swampy plains with long grass, cane, and shrubs in central Thailand, particularly in the Chao Phraya River valley near Bangkok. This deer avoided dense vegetation. They lived in herds that consisted of a single adult male, a few females, and their young. However, during the flooding that occurred during the rainy season, the herds were forced together upon higher pieces of land which could turn into islands. This made them easy targets for hunters.
Extinction
Commercial production of rice for export began in the late 19th century in Thailand, leading to the loss of nearly all grassland and swamp areas on which this deer depended. Intensive hunting pressure at the turn of the century restricted the species further until it became extinct.
The wild population of Schomburgk’s deer is thought to have died because of overhunting in 1932, with the last captive individual being killed in 1938. The species is also listed as extinct in the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, some scientists consider this species to be still extant. Only one mounted specimen is known to be in existence, which currently resides in Paris's Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle after living in the zoo there until 1868.
In 1991, antlers were discovered in a Chinese medicine shop in Laos. Laurent Chazée, an agronomist with the United Nations, later identified the antlers from a photograph he took as coming from Schomburgk's deer.

Maryam Abdulhadi al-Khawaja (Arabic: مريم عبد الهادي الخواجة‎, b. 26 June 1987) is a Bahraini human rights activist. She is the daughter of the Bahraini human rights activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja and head of the foreign relations office and vice president for the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights. She has been the acting President of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights since Nabeel Rajab was arrested.



Life
Maryam was born in Syria to Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, who had been banned from Bahrain since the mid-1980s and Khadija Almousawi. At the age of two her family was able to get political asylum in Denmark. They lived there until 2001, when they were allowed re-entry into Bahrain.
After graduating from the University of Bahrain in 2009, Maryam al-Khawaja spent a year in the United States on a Fulbright scholarship at Brown University. When she returned to Bahrain in mid-2010, however, she was unable to find work in public relations or education due to her father's reputation as a government critic. Instead she joined the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, co-founded by her father, where she headed the foreign relations office and became vice president, serving as acting president during BCHR's president, Nabeel Rajab periods of detention.
On 22 June 2011, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, Maryam’s father, was sentenced to life imprisonment in a military court on the charge of "organizing and managing a terrorist organization" for his role in the pro-democracy 2011-2012 Bahraini uprising.
Human rights activism
Maryam Alkhawaja was active in participating in protests and volunteering for human rights organizations since she was a young teenager. She also worked as a fixer and translator for journalists who came to Bahrain to report on the situation there. In 2006, Maryam was part of the delegation that went to the UN building in New York and met with the Secretary-General’s assistant to hand over the mass petition of demanding that the Prime Minister resign, due to his human rights violations. In 2008, Maryam was invited by the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission to testify at US Congress about religious freedom in Bahrain. The government led a smear campaign in the media against the group of activists that spoke at this session including Maryam, and their case was adopted by organizations such as Frontline, OMCT and FIDH.
Involvement in the Bahraini uprising
After attending the early pro-democracy demonstrations in 2011, Maryam al-Khawaja embarked on an overseas speaking tour at colleges and conferences. During this tour, she held meetings with UK politicians, and spoke to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. With Nabeel Rajab prevented from leaving Bahrain, problems of access for the external media and at least 500 leading members of the opposition detained, Maryam al-Khawaja assumed a prominent public role outside Bahrain. According to Joe Stork of Human Rights Watch, BCHR recommended that she stay abroad given the likelihood of arrest if she returned.
In April, al-Khawaja participated in the U.S.-Islamic World Forum, where she was able to speak to Secreatary of State Hillary Clinton and tell the story of her father and two brothers in-law arrest. She implored Clinton for the United States to take a stronger stance against the oppression in Bahrain, and cited the Bahraini government's use of American weapons to suppress the protesters, as a reason for the United States to do. In May, she spoke to the Oslo Freedom Forum about her experiences with government violence in Bahrain. On 13 May, she gave evidence to a U.S. Congress hearing on Human Rights in Bahrain.
Online activity
Before the Bahraini uprising, al-Khawaja was not active on Twitter, with no more than 30 followers. As of 15 June, she has more than 65,000 followers and had sent more than 18,000 tweets, providing real-time coverage of various protests oft overlooked by many formal news agencies. As demonstrators flooded the streets, she stayed for days on end in Manama's Pearl Roundabout actively tweeting.
Threats and harassment
Maryam al-Khawaja has faced internet harassment from regime supporters. She did not attend an IFEX in Lebanon in early June after receiving death threats. Immediately after her speech to the Oslo Freedom Forum (streamed live online) a Twitter campaign began, accusing her of spreading false news, being a radical and working for the Iranian government. Many messages accusing Maryam of being a "traitor" for Bahrain were sent to the email account of Oslo Freedom Forum. Much of the tweeting, blogging and online harassment has originated in the U.S., inside the Geo-Political Solutions division of Qorvis Communications. The campaign has also included apparently organized heckling.
According to FIDH, in early May 2011, an anonymous smear campaign was launched against Nabeel Rajab and Maryam al-Khawaja "with the active support of the Bahraini authorities."

Elections to the United States House of Representatives were held in 1898 for members of the 56th Congress, and took place in the middle of President William McKinley's first term.
As in many midterm elections, the President's Republican Party lost seats, but was able to hold a majority over the Democratic Party. The Populist Party also lost many seats, as their movement began to decline. This was likely because many Populists rallied behind William Jennings Bryan's increasingly powerful branch of the Democratic Party, which built the rural economic issues advocated by Populists into their platform. As a result, the Democrats won a number of Western seats as well many in the Mid-Atlantic.

Election summaries

The previous election of 1896 saw the election of 24 Populists, 2 Silver Republicans, and a Silver Party member.
Early election dates
In 1898, three states, with 8 seats among them, held elections early:
June 6 Oregon
September 6 Vermont

Major Anya Amasova (aka Agent XXX) is a fictional character in the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me, portrayed by Barbara Bach. In the film, Amasova is an agent of the KGB.

Biography
After the theft of a submarine, M recalls Bond from a mission where he is currently in a cabin located in Austria (in the novelisation, on the top of Aiguille du Mort, a mountain near the town of Chamonix). While leaving Bond is ambushed by a Russian team, but is able to kill one of them in self-defense prior to parachuting off the mountain. Unbeknownst to Bond, the agent he killed is Amasova's lover Sergei Barsov. She has also been recalled from a mission by General Gogol of the KGB.
Anya meets Bond during a show at the Pyramids in Egypt, where her thugs fight with Bond when she believes he has killed Fekkesh, an Egyptian contact whose body has been found in one of the pyramids. The real killer was Jaws.
However, they become formally introduced to one another in Cairo when they both arrive at Max Kalba's club. After spouting various biographical details to each other (for example, Anya is aware of Bond's doomed marriage), they attempt to outbid one another for a secret microfilm. When Kalba is killed by Jaws, they travel across Egypt tracking the microfilm. After Anya ultimately outwits Bond for the microfilm (but Bond had reviewed it), they report to the Abu Simbel temple where Gogol and M have decided to work together to find out how and why their submarines are being stolen while at sea.
For most of the film Bond and Anya have the same mission objectives and try to achieve the same goals often by attempting to outdo one another, during which they fall in love. While travelling to Sardinia by train they share a meal together and while Anya is preparing for bed in her carriage, having politely declined Bond's offer of a nightcap, she is attacked by Jaws. Bond hears the sounds of a struggle over the noise of the train and arrives just in time to save her from being killed. After a brief fight Jaws is despatched out of a window and Bond returns to Anya, who tends to a cut on his shoulder before they kiss and ultimately spend the night together. On Sardinia Anya accompanies Bond to meet Karl Stromberg posing as his wife. Afterwards Anya learns that 007 killed her lover. She then tells Bond that she will ultimately have revenge once their mission is complete.
Anya is later captured by Stromberg and held captive at Atlantis, Stromberg's undersea base. Bond sneaks aboard and rescues her. As the mission reaches its end, she points her gun at Bond, only to discover that she is too in love with him to kill him.
Anya (pointing gun at Bond), tells him: "The mission is over, Commander". At that moment, as Anya is tightening her finger on the trigger, the cork pops off of a champagne bottle that Bond is in the process of opening. Anya smiles, stifling a giggle, and Bond says "In my country, Major, the condemned man is usually allowed a final request" to which she says "Granted". Bond then suggests that they get out of their wet clothes.
When the escape pod with James and Anya goes into the ship Bond saved from Stromberg's 'instruments of Armageddon', Q, M, and Anya's superiors from Russia look inside a window at James and Anya making love in the luxury bed in awe. "James!" Anya says as she's the first one in the pod to see the duo's superiors.
It was planned to have Amasova make a cameo in Moonraker (which was released in 1979), as the woman in bed with General Gogol, but this never happened.
Reception
Entertainment Weekly ranks Amasova as the fifth best Bond girl. Fandango ranks her as part of their best Bond Girls. All Women Stalk named her as the fourth sexiest Bond girl. About.com ranked Amasova as number seven in their list of best Bond girls. Bond-Girls.net called Amasova "one of the sexiest and most beautiful Bond-Girls...a brand-new type of Bond-Girl".
Critical Studies
In Shaken  Stirred: The Feminism of James Bond, scholar Robert A. Caplen argues that Anya's character "is groundbreaking within the Bond Girl paradigm" because she is "imbued with a plausibility that surpasses her predecessors . . . ." Nevertheless, Caplen observes that Anya's "significant moments of independence and assertiveness are tempered by the constraints inherent in the successful Bondian formula . . . ."

The church is part of the Saltstraumen parish in the Bodø deanery in the Diocese of Sør-Hålogaland. The white, wooden church was built in 1886. Around 1900 it was moved about 300 metres (980 ft) away from its original location due to soil instability.

Donnacona is an industrial town located about 40 kilometres (25 mi) west of Quebec City in Portneuf County, Quebec, Canada.

History
Some people believe the city was named after Donnacona, a 16th-century Wendat (Huron) chief who was taken to France. The Huron chieftain lived further down-river in Stadacona.
It was actually named after the first paper mill erected at the mouth of the Jacques-Cartier River, The Donnacona Paper Ltd. It was located where the Jacques-Cartier River meets the St. Lawrence River. The local paper mill played a key role in creating and quickly developing the local settlement to the point of making of Donnacona the most populous urban town in Portneuf County. Economic difficulties affected the lumber and pulp and paper industry and the local factory was sold a number of times. In 2007, Bowater had a debt of $7 billion and merged with Abitibi-Consolidated. The merger was to sell off Abitibi's assets and close its mills for liquidity to settle Bowater's debt. It closed in January 2008. It had employed 240 people manufacturing of 230,000 tonnes per annum of commercial grade paper. The demolition was scheduled to take 12 to 14 months. For three years, the town unsuccessfully tried to find an entrepreneur to re-start the industry. Demolition began in March 2011.
Prior to the chartering of Donnacona as a town in 1915, the area was named Pointe-aux-Écureuils. A New France Seigneurie existed under the name of Les Écureuils as a surrounding rural parish municipality prior to its final merge with Donnacona in 1967.

OPCS-4, or more formally OPCS Classification of Interventions and Procedures version 4, is the procedural classification used by clinical coders within National Health Service (NHS) hospitals of NHS England, NHS Scotland, NHS Wales and Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland. It is based on the earlier Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Surgical Operations and Procedures (4th revision), and retains the OPCS abbreviation from this now defunct publication.
OPCS-4 codifies operations, procedures and interventions performed during in-patient stays, day case surgery and some out-patient treatments in NHS hospitals. Though the code structure is different, as a code set, OPCS-4 is comparable to the American Medical Association's Current Procedural Terminology.
As a publication, OPCS-4 is split into two volumes; a tabular list (Volume I) and an alphabetical index (Volume II). An electronic version is also available. However, a number of supplementary publications are also used by coding staff.

History
The first NHS procedural classification was published in 1987, by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) as the Classification of Surgical Operations. In 1992 the 4th revision was released as the OPCS Classification of Surgical Operations and Procedures (4th revision), usually shorted to OPCS-4.2. Responsibility for the classifications used in the NHS, including OPCS-4, passed to the NHS Information Authority (NHS IA) when it formed in 1999.
By 2003, the NHS IA had realised OPCS-4.2 no longer accurately reflected many of the procedures being performed in the UK healthcare system. As a medium term measure, a project to replace OPCS-4 with a more robust method of procedure coding was proposed and partially developed. Rather than using a sequence of codes to capture activity, the new classification would have used a single alphanumeric code up to 15 characters long. When the NHS IA was superseded by NHS Connecting for Health (NHS CFH) in 2005, the project was placed on indefinite hold, and a program of annual revisions to OPCS-4 was implemented. Much of the development work for the suspended project was reused to produce the initial expansion and enhancement of OPCS-4.2 to OPCS-4.3. However, OPCS-4.2 remained the mandated method of procedural classification in the NHS setting until March 2006.
Since the implementation of OPCS-4.3 in April 2006 there have been four further revisions to OPCS-4. Each becoming the mandated classification on 1 April in the year of publication.
OPCS-4 version mandated for use (financial year)
Up to 31 March 2006 OPCS-4.2
2006-7 OPCS-4.3
2007-9 OPCS-4.4
2009-11 OPCS-4.5
2011-14 OPCS-4.6
2014 OPCS-4.7 (until further notice)
Whilst additions to OPCS-4 are reviewed on an annual basis, the long term plan is to replace OPCS-4 with SNOMED CT.
On 31 March 2013 NHS CFH ceased to exist. Since 1 April 2013, responsibility for revision and maintenance of OPCS-4 has been with the Health and Social Care Information Centre's Clinical Classifications Service.
Code structure
OPCS-4 is an alphanumeric nomenclature, with a 4 character code system similar to that found in ICD-10. The differences being that OPCS-4 classifies procedures and interventions, rather than diagnoses, and that the chapters do not correlate (i.e. Chapter A of OPCS does not classify treatments for conditions in Chapter I of ICD-10).
The first character is always a letter. Second, third and fourth characters are always numbers. A . separates the third and fourth characters; for example
Volume I - Tabular List
OPCS-4 Volume I is split into 24 chapters:
Chapter A - Nervous System
Chapter B - Endocrine System and Breast
Chapter C - Eye
Chapter D - Ear
Chapter E - Respiratory Tract
Chapter F - Mouth
Chapter G - Upper Digestive System
Chapter H - Lower Digestive System
Chapter J - Other Abdominal Organs, Principally Digestive
Chapter K - Heart
Chapter L - Arteries and Veins
Chapter M - Urinary
Chapter N - Male Genital Organs
Chapter P - Lower Female Genital Tract
Chapter Q - Upper Female Genital Tract
Chapter R - Female Genital Tract Associated with Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Puerperium
Chapter S - Skin
Chapter T - Soft Tissue
Chapter U - Diagnostic Imaging, Testing and Rehabilitation
Chapter V - Bones and Joints of Skull and Spine
Chapter W - Other Bones and Joints
Chapter X - Miscellaneous Operations
Chapter Y - Subsidiary Classification of Methods of Operation
Chapter Z - Subsidiary Classification of Sites of Operation
"Missing" chapters
I codes
There is currently no Chapter I. Nor are there any codes beginning with an "I".
O codes
Whilst there is no Chapter O, codes beginning with an "O" can be found in OPCS-4. These were added to chapters when all the available 3-character code blocks were exhausted, but further classifications were needed. They are also referred to as "overflow codes", and are located at the end of the related chapter. When indexing a procedure or intervention that is classified to an O code, the letter denoting the chapter the code is found in is given in parentheses after the code.
Volume II - Alphabetical Index
OPCS-4 Volume II is an index for looking up codes in Volume I. It is bad practice to use it by itself, as some trails only index to the 3rd character category, rather than the 4th character rubric.
It is split into four numbered sections and an introduction.
Introduction
The introduction gives a brief guide on using OPCS-4 and defines some abbreviations, for example NEC (Not Elsewhere Classified).
Section I – Alphabetical Index of Interventions and Procedures
This is the main bulk of the index, and contains the mechanism of looking up codes in the tabular list.
Terms are indexed in a What? Where? How? method. For example, oesophagogastroduodenoscopy is trailed via Examination Gastrointestinal Tract Upper Endoscopic Fibreoptic.
Section II – Alphabetical Index of Surgical Eponyms
This list of surgical eponyms, contains common NHS procedures that may also be known by the surgeon, team or institution that developed the method or device used. For example the Birmingham hip resurfacing and the Thompson Hemiarthroplasty.
Care must be taken when using trailing via Section II for two reasons:
The eponyms given are based on the original description, of the original procedure. If a modified version of the procedure has performed, for example a modified Akin osteotomy, or if the operation has been performed in conjunction with another procedure, e.g. Akin and Scarf osteotomies, the W15.6 code given in the index may not be correct.
Only a single term is used to index the eponyms, i.e. Birmingham rather than Birmingham hip resurfacing. This means that care must be taken where the same eponym has been used more than once. For example, on indexing Thompson, you find four separate entries that apply to different procedures: Thompson's lymphoedema correction, cemented Thompson hemiarthroplasty, uncemented Thompson hemiarthroplasty, and Thompson's quadricepsplasty
Section III – Alphabetical Index of Surgical Abbreviations
This section of the Volume II contains a nonexhaustive, alphabetical list of abbreviations and their definitions. For example, ECMO - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation.
The reason the descriptor of the abbreviation is given is to clarify the few instances where the abbreviation has been used more than once. For example, SST could stand for Serum Skin Test or Short Synacthen Test.
Section IV – Alphabetical Index of Common Surgical Suffixes
This section of Volume II is a single page glossary containing suffixes that are used throughout the classification. For example, -otomy.
Supplementary publications
There are a number of publications that supplement OPCS-4.
Instruction Manual
The OPCS-4.6 Clinical Coding Instruction Manual is a reference book on how to use OPCS-4 to national standards. It is initially supplied to novice coders who attend a foundation course run by an Approved Trainer. Whilst each revision to OPCS-4 sees the issue of a new manual, updates are issued electronically, and the onus is on coders to update them by hand.
With the introduction of OPCS-4.7, and the move of maintenance responsibility to HSCIC, the instruction manual has been renamed to National Clinical Coding Standards OPCS-4.
The Coding Clinic
The Coding Clinic publication is how minor changes and coding advice for both ICD-10 and OPCS-4 are disseminated through the UK clinical coding community. Initially issued as a printed newsletter, in 2012 the format was switched to a single, compendium-like electronic publication.
High Cost Drugs List
Maintained by the Department of Health's (DH) Payment by Results team; the High Cost Drugs List is a catalogue of drugs licensed for use in the NHS that are excluded from the Payment by Results (PbR) tariff.
Issued annually - even in years with no revision to OPCS-4 - the list consists of the generic names of certain drugs next to the relevant OPCS-4 code. The guidance section of the list states that it is down to the clinical staff to use the generic instead of brand names.
Chemotherapy Regimens List
The Chemotherapy Regimens List, also issued by the DH Payment by Results team, is for the coding of administration of antineoplastic drugs. Organised alphabetically, the list contains adult and paediatric chemotherapy regimens used in the NHS. Drug trials are excluded as they are usually financed by the trial's commissioner, for example a pharmaceutical company or cancer charity.
The National Clinical Coding Standards OPCS-4 and both of the DH lists are issued to coders via Terminology Reference Data Update Distribution Service (TRUD)[1]

Biography
Adelman was born and raised in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv, the 8th generation of a German-Jewish family hailing from Jerusalem. Adelman used the TAU's musicology department where he worked as a setting for his first thriller novel, Concerto for Spy and Orchestra. His second novel, Lost and Found, was a fantasy novel about Ashkenazi moshavnik Mossad agents, who alternated frequenting the Jerusalem Cinematheque with flying secretly to Cyprus. Written using short chapters and clear, direct Hebrew, the novels were bestsellers in Israel, culminating in translations to German, Greek and Japanese. Critics in Israel praised Lost and Found as "the perfect Israeli thriller", and his writing has received favourable comparisons with John Grisham.
In addition to 4 novels, Adelman wrote computer textbooks for the general public. He died from a heart attack in a hotel room in Ramat Aviv, Tel Aviv, where he was writing his next thriller.

Bio at The Institute for the Translation of Hebrew Literature
Frank Sawyer MBE (1906–1980) was an English river manager, writer, and inventor of such flies as the Pheasant Tail Nymph. Sawyer also invented a number of different animal traps some of which bore his name, and the most widely used (the Imbra) is still approved for use in the UK although no longer in production. He died in 1980 on the banks of the River Avon at Netheravon.

Early life
Sawyer was born at the Mill House in the village of Bulford on the banks of the River Avon in Wiltshire.
Career as river keeper
Sawyer's first job as a river keeper was in 1925 on the River Avon at Lake in Wiltshire, just north of Salisbury. He was employed by Lieutenant-Colonel Bailley as assistant keeper to Fred Martin and managed the six miles of river around Lake House, now owned by the musician Sting.
In 1928 he moved as head keeper to the waters of the Officers' Fishing Association, which later became the Services Dry Fly Fishing Association (SDFFA). Sawyer served as head keeper with the SDFFA until his death in 1980. The SDFFA waters included some six miles of prime chalk stream fishing on Salisbury Plain and a number of small lakes that were constructed by Frank Sawyer in the 1960s.
By the time Sawyer took over as head keeper on the SDFFA waters, natural regeneration of wild trout had dropped markedly due to the decline of the water meadows, increased pollution and large amounts of silt running into the river from surrounding farm land and the Army’s tank manoeuvres on Salisbury Plain. By the early 1930s the fishery could no longer sustain a wild trout population large enough to meet the demands of fishermen. Frank Sawyer determined through detailed observation of the river that the mortality of eggs in the redds was virtually 100%. However, those few fry that did hatch had a reasonable chance of survival. Frank Sawyer introduced a large scale programme to stock the river with trout fry. Mature wild trout were caught from the Nine Mile River and other tributaries, stripped of their eggs and milt, and then returned to the river. The fertilised eggs were then reared in a purpose built hatchery designed by Sawyer before being released back into the river. Some 100,000 fry were stocked in the river each year from 1930–1953 and resulted in around 2000 large fish being caught each year and a great many more that eluded the fishermen.
Despite the success of the trout fry stocking programme, the health of the River Avon continued to decline. The river bed became compacted and many parts of the river turned into muddy, stagnant bogs from all the silt and mud running off the surrounding land and the untreated sewage and farm waste that ended up in the river. The river was rapidly becoming unsuitable for trout. Frank Sawyer undertook a major project in the early 1950s known as ‘the great clean up.’ This involved dredging the worst hit areas of the river to remove mud and silt and return the bed to chalk and gravel. Old sluices and hatch gates that impounded or reduced flow were removed to speed up the flow and scour the beds clear of filth. Old water meadow carrier streams were restored to provide a natural filter and a nursery for small fish and insects. Finally silt catchment pits were dug in the worst hit areas to prevent the silt and run off from reaching the main river. The great clean up had a huge and profound effect on the River Avon. The river returned to its former glory as one of the world’s premier chalk streams. There was no longer a requirement to stock trout as the natural regeneration was sufficient. There was an explosion in fly and other river life and the fishing was described by all SDFFA members as the best in the history of the river.
Unfortunately the effects of the great clean up did not last more than a few years. By the late 1950s the river’s health started to decline again. Organic mud from rotting leaves built up in a few areas but the main problem was the lack of growth in the fish despite an apparent abundance of fly. It once again became necessary to conduct large scale stocking of trout to met fishing demands. The remedy this time was the addition of fine chalk powder in large quantities throughout the fishery. Sawyer’s discovery on the importance of chalk was made partly by accident and remained controversial long after his death. Sawyer noticed that when one of the lakes in the fishery was dredged, a large amount of chalk was washed into suspension. A few months later the trout in the lake had grown much fatter and were markedly bigger than the fish in the main river. Sawyer identified that the chalk cleared the water, broke down organic matter and caused an explosion in insect, snail and crustacean numbers – all important food sources for trout. Sawyer set about adding chalk to the entire fishery. The results were astounding and similar chalking carried out in France achieved equally marked results. Unfortunately, the use of chalk failed to gain much traction in fishery management as the practice of stocking large, easy to catch farm reared trout was becoming more widespread. The health of the water and food supply was much less relevant as the farm reared fish were often caught within days of being stocked and had enough fat to last a season. The natural regeneration of trout ceased to be a factor in fishery management and the water only had to be healthy enough to keep the trout alive long enough to be caught. The SDFFA and other more traditional fisheries continued to work on natural regeneration and healthy waters but the demands of chalking 6 miles of river were too much for a fishery working on a tight budget and the SDFFA adopted a stocking policy using trout reared in its own stock ponds.
Frank Sawyer nymphs
Sawyer is probably best remembered for the development of the ‘sunken nymph’ and the associated nymphing technique sometimes called the Netheravon Style. Sawyer’s nymphs were innovative in that they were tied with fine copper wire instead of silk or thread. This allowed the nymphs to sink and also gave them a translucent colouring when under water. Sawyer advocated the ‘sink and draw’ method of nymphing where the nymph was allowed to sink and then made to ‘swim’ towards the surface by drawing in the line or slowly lifting the rod tip. This was coupled with the ‘induced take' where the nymph was made to swim up in front of a fish thereby inducing the fish to take. The Netheravon style of nymph fishing learnt from Frank Sawyer was initially popularised by the naturalist, fly fisherman and television presenter Oliver Kite in his 1963 book, republished with a biographical introduction by Robert Spaight in 2000 Nymph Fishing in Practice.
The Pheasant Tail Nymph was the first and still most widely used of Sawyer's weighted nymphs. It is tied with fine copper wire and the tail feathers of the European cock pheasant. The Pheasant Tail Nymph is designed as a generic nymph pattern and imitates any of the dark coloured swimming nymphs.
The Grey Goose Nymph was tied in exactly the same manner as the Pheasant Tail Nymph but tied with light grey goose feathers. The Grey Goose nymph is a generic pattern designed to imitate the lighter coloured swimming nymphs.
The Sawyer Swedish Nymph was designed during Frank Sawyer's visit to the Storan River system in Sweden with the famous Scandinavian fishermen Nils Farnstrom. Sawyer wrote about this trip in Nymphs and the Trout. The Sawyer Swedish Nymph is tied with a dark grey goose feather that matches the nymph of the Summer Mayfly.
Sawyer developed the Killer Bug as a means of controlling greyling numbers on the River Avon where at the time it was considered vermin. The Killer Bug is designed to imitate the freshwater shrimp but also looks similar to a hatching sedge. The Killer Bug was named by Sawyer's friend Lee Wulff. It is tied with large amounts of copper wire and light beige wool. Originally the Killer Bug was tied with a wool called Chadwick's 477. When production of this wool ceased in 1965 Sawyer switched to a specially produced copy. In fly fishing circles the original Chadwick's 477 wool is considered to have mythical fish-catching properties with lengths of the wool selling for hundreds of pounds.
The Bow Tie Buzzer was the last of Sawyer's nymphs. It has a unique design than allows the hook to rotate freely on the tippet. The Bow Tie Buzzer is designed to imitate the large midge larvae found in still waters. The pattern is tied with pheasant feathers and tin foil with a white wool 'bow tie' used to imitate the cilia. The Bow Tie Buzzer must be attached to the tippet in a specific manner to allow the pattern to function properly. First the hook is threaded onto the tippet and allowed to run up and down the line freely. Secondly, a piece of white wool is tied on to the very end of the tippet. This stops the free-running hook from coming off the end of the tippet. Once cast onto still water, the hook can rotate freely in the same manner as natural midge larvae.
The Frank Sawyer Nymphs are still sold today by Sawyer Nymphs Ltd. These nymphs are tied in the original manner and made with the traditional materials used by Sawyer.
Career as author
Sawyer was a prolific writer and wrote hundreds of articles and copious notes on his observations and experiments. Some of his early articles were compiled in the now classic book Keeper of the Stream. This was first published in 1952 by A.  C. Black and has been republished a number of times since. The most recent edition (2005) is a special limited edition published by Sawyer Nymphs Ltd and contains a new chapter of previously unpublished material and some photographs.
The best known of Sawyer's books is Nymphs and the Trout. The first of several editions was published in 1958 by Stanley Paul  Co., and the book has been translated into other languages. The latest publication (2006) is a special limited edition from Sawyer Nymphs Ltd that incorporates the first and second editions, a new chapter of previously unpublished material, a lengthy introduction by Frank's only son Tim and some photographs.
A biography of Sawyer entitled Man of the Riverside written by Sidney Vines was published by George Allen and Unwin in 1984. It incorporated some of Frank Sawyer's magazine articles and some of his unpublished work.
In 2006, Sawyer's grandson Nick Sawyer published a book through Sawyer Nymphs Ltd entitled Frank Sawyer's Nymphing Secrets. This included some previously unpublished work by Frank Sawyer on the art of nymphing.

Ahmed Omar (Arabic: احمد عمر‎) is a Qatari-Lebanese football coach and former striker who played for Al Sadd. He is currently an AFC Elite Coaching Instructor and regularly heads training sessions for young coaches in Asia. He is the only person in the history of the Emir Cup to win the title as both, coach and player.
He retired from playing after Al Sadd lost the 1983 Emir Cup final to Al Arabi. Geraldão scored the only goal of the match in the 80th minute from a direct free kick. After the match, there was a mass brawl between the two teams, and the field was described as a 'boxing ring'. The referee of the match, Mustafa Ezzat, decided to retire, and the chairman of the referee's association, Hani Taleb, also decided to retire. Although Al Sadd won the league that season, he felt that it did not make up for losing in the Emir Cup or the ill natured events which occurred after the loss. He went on to coach Al Sadd, first in 1987–88, winning the Emir Cup that year, and again in 1993–94, when he also won the Emir Cup.

Epitonium is a genus of small predatory sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks. Epitonium is the type genus of the family Epitoniidae, the wentletraps.
The common name wentletraps is derived from the Dutch word wenteltrap, denoting a spiral staircase. This refers to the striking form and sculpture of the shells of the mollusks in this genus, and to a lesser extent, the whole family.
The genus Epitonium has been divided in the past by some authors into several subgenera, but these subgenera were based only on shell characters and did not reflect the true underlying relationships or phylogeny.

Shell description
Epitonium shells are high-spired, and are all-white in most of the species within this genus. A few species are tinted with brown to varying degrees, or have a brown stripe on the shoulder of the whorl. The shells typically have blade-like vertical ribs, known as costae.
Habitat
Wentletraps usually live in sand near sea anemones or corals.
Life habits
These snails are predators and feed by inserting their proboscis and biting out small pieces of the anemone's tissues. Some species of wentletrap feed on only one species of sea anemone, in other words they are species-specific in terms of their prey.
Synonymised genera
Many species that now are placed in the genus Epitonium have, over the years, been classified in other genera. These have become synonyms of Epitonium :

Species


Species within the genus Epitonium include:
Note: Some malacologists have recently placed many of the more than 600 named species into other genera, which were previously considered to be subgenera of the genus Epitonium. On the other hand, many species that belonged to subgenera of Epitonium are now included in Epitonium. These subgenera were based on details of the shell sculpture and not on molecular analysis.

ReferencesA magnetic stripe card is a type of card capable of storing data by modifying the magnetism of tiny iron-based magnetic particles on a band of magnetic material on the card. The magnetic stripe, sometimes called swipe card or magstripe, is read by swiping past a magnetic reading head. Magnetic stripe cards are commonly used in credit cards, identity cards, and transportation tickets. They may also contain an RFID tag, a transponder device and/or a microchip mostly used for business premises access control or electronic payment.
Magnetic recording on steel tape and wire was invented during World War II for recording audio. In the 1950s, magnetic recording of digital computer data on plastic tape coated with iron oxide was invented. In 1960 IBM used the magnetic tape idea to develop a reliable way of securing magnetic stripes to plastic cards, under a contract with the US government for a security system. A number of International Organization for Standardization standards, ISO/IEC 7810, ISO/IEC 7811, ISO/IEC 7812, ISO/IEC 7813, ISO 8583, and ISO/IEC 4909, now define the physical properties of the card, including size, flexibility, location of the magstripe, magnetic characteristics, and data formats. They also provide the standards for financial cards, including the allocation of card number ranges to different card issuing institutions.

The magnetic stripe

Magnetic storage was already known from World War II and computer data storage in the 1950s.
In 1969 Forrest Parry, an IBM engineer, had the idea of securing a piece of magnetic tape, the predominant storage medium at the time, to a plastic card base. He became frustrated because every adhesive he tried produced unacceptable results. The tape strip either warped or its characteristics were affected by the adhesive, rendering the tape strip unusable. After a frustrating day in the laboratory, trying to get the right adhesive, he came home with several pieces of magnetic tape and several plastic cards. As he walked in the door at home, his wife Dorothea was ironing clothing. When he explained the source of his frustration: inability to get the tape to "stick" to the plastic in a way that would work, she suggested that he use the iron to melt the stripe on. He tried it and it worked. The heat of the iron was just high enough to bond the tape to the card.
First magnetic striped plastic credit and badge access cards



The major development of the magnetic striped plastic card began in 1969 at the IBM Information Records Division (IRD) headquartered in Dayton N.J. In 1970 the marketing organization was transferred by IBM DPD back to the Information Records Division in order to begin sales and marketing strategies for the magnetically striped and encoded cards being developed. It took almost two years for IBM IRD engineers to not only develop the process for reliably applying the magnetic stripe to plastic cards via a hot stamping method (see PICTURE A), but also develop the process for encoding the magnetic stripe utilizing the IBM Delta Distance C Optical Bar Code format. This engineering effort resulted in IBM IRD producing the first magnetic striped plastic credit and ID cards used by banks, insurance companies, hospitals and many others. Another result of this project was that IBM IRD and IBM Data Processing Division announced on February 24, 1971 the first Magnetic Credit Card Service Center and the IBM 2730-1 Transaction Validation Terminal. Arthur E. Hahn Jr. was hired by IBM IRD in Dayton, N.J. on Aug 12, 1969 (LETTER A:) to head up this engineering effort. Other members of the group were David Morgan (Manager), Billy House (Software Developer), William Creeden (Programmer), and E. J. Gillen (Mechanical Engineering/Machining). They were given a recently announced IBM 360 Model 30 computer with 50k of RAM for control of the encoding/embossing of the Magnetic Stripe Cards. The IBM 360 computer was for scientific/business applications so the IRD engineers first had to convert the 360 into a "process control computer" and then develop software and hardware around it. Due to the limited RAM the software was developed in 360 Assembler Language. This conversion enabled the 360 computer to monitor and control the entire production process the IRD engineers designed and built. The engineering design/build effort was carried out in a raised floor secured area of IBM IRD in Dayton, N.J. which was built specifically for the project. This tightly secured area with limited access was required because of the sensitivity of the data that would ultimately be used to encode and emboss the credit and ID cards.
Bar code encoding developments
The IRD engineers first had to develop a reliable process of hot stamping the magnetic stripe to the plastic cards. This was necessary in order to meet the close tolerances required to reliably encode and read the data on the Magnetic Stripe Cards by magnetic write/read heads. The magnetic stripe was encoded with a single track of data utilizing the IBM Delta Distance C Optical Bar Code format. The Delta Distance C Optical Bar Code was developed by the IBM Systems Development Division working at Research Triangle Park in Raleigh North Carolina headed up by George J. Laurer. Other members of the group were N. Joseph Woodland, Paul McEnroe, Dr. Robert Evans, Bernard Silver, Art Hamburgen, Heard Baumeister and Bill Crouse. The IBM group in Raleigh was competing with RCA, Litton-Zellweger and other companies who were working with the National Retail Merchants Association NRMA to develop a standard optical bar code to be used in the retail industry. NRMA wanted an optically readable code that could be printed on products allowing purchasers to rapidly “check out” at the new electronic cash register/checkout counters being developed. The code would also be used for production and inventory control of products. Of the many optical bar codes submitted to NRMA by IBM and other companies, NRMA finally selected the later version of the IBM bar code known as the Delta Distance D Optical Bar Code format. The Delta Distance C Code was an earlier version of the UPC Universal Product Code. The UPC code was selected in 1973 by NRMA as their standard and has become the World Wide Standard that we all know today as the UPC Uniform Product Code.
The production process
In 1971, after the IBM IRD engineers completed the development and building phase of the project they began in 1969, they released the equipment to the IRD manufacturing group in Dayton N.J. to begin producing the plastic magnetic striped credit and ID cards. Because of the sensitivity of the customer data and the security requirements of banks, insurance companies and others, the manufacturing group decided to leave the entire line in the secured area where it was developed.
Banks, insurance companies, hospitals etc., supplied IBM IRD with “raw plastic cards” preprinted with their logos, contact information etc. They also supplied the data information which was to be encoded and embossed on the cards. This data was supplied to IRD on large 0.5 inch wide; 10.5 inch diameter IBM Magnetic Tape Reels which was the standard for computers at that time. The manufacturing process started by first applying the magnetic stripe to the preprinted plastic cards via the hot stamping process developed by the IBM IRD engineers. This operation of applying the magnetic stripe to the plastic cards was done off line in another area of IBM IRD and not in the secured area. The cards were then brought into the secured area and placed in “hoppers” at the beginning of the production line. The tape reels containing the data were then installed on the modified IBM 360 computer prior to beginning the encoding, embossing and verification of the cards. After the 360 performed a check to verify that all systems and stations were loaded and ready to go, the computer began feeding the Magnetic Striped Plastic Cards from the hoppers at the front end of the production line down a motorized track. The entire operation was fully automated and controlled by the modified IBM 360 business computer. The line consisted of the following stations and operations:
Plastic card feeder station: The cards were fed down a track in single file from card hoppers.
Magnetic write/read encoding station: The IBM 360 computer sent over the data which was encoded on the magnetic stripe utilizing the IBM Delta Distance C Optical Bar Code format. The card passed under the read head and the encoded data was sent back to the 360 for verification.
An embossing station: The IRD engineers purchased and modified a Data Card Corp embossing machine and interfaced it with the IBM 360 computer to emboss the cards. The original design concept called for an Addressograph-Multigraph embossing machine, however, the IRD engineers quickly switched to a Data Card Corp embossing machine. Data Card Corp, a Minneapolis/St. Paul company had just developed the first electronically controlled embossing machine for plastic cards and effectively obsoleted all other mechanical operated embossers.
A topping station: To highlight the embossing.
An imprinter station: To imprint the embossing on an automatically fed paper roll.
An optical reader station: To read the embossed information off the paper roll and feed it back to the 360 computer for verification.
A one card rejection station: If either the encoding or embossing data on the card was not verified by the 360 computer, that one card was rejected. If both the encoded and embossed data was confirmed by the 360 computer, the card proceeded down the line.
A mailer station: A mailer was printed with the name and address of the card holder along with the date and other relevant card information. These mailers were also preprinted and die cut by IRD according to the customers specs and logo requirements and were fed into the line out of boxes in a continuous fan feed method.
A card insertion station: Here the card was automatically inserted onto the mailer.
A bursting and folding station: Here the mailers were burst apart and then folded into a 3 fold packet that would fit into a business size envelope.
An envelope printer/ insertion station: Here an envelope was printed with the name and address of the customer and the mailer containing the card was automatically inserted into the envelope and sealed.
This completed the manufacturing line for the magnetic striped encoded and embossed plastic credit and badge access cards. The envelopes were then taken to be posted and mailed directly to the customers of the companies who had ordered the cards from IRD.
What this small engineering group at IBM IRD and the IBM Bar Code development group in Raleigh accomplished in developing the first magnetic stripe credit and ID cards cannot be overstated. They laid the foundation for the entire magnetic stripe card industry that we know and use today through our use of credit cards, ATM cards, ID cards, hotel room and access cards, transportation tickets, and all the terminals and card readers that read the cards and enter the data into computers. Their developments resulted in every person having the ability to easily carry a card that connects them directly to computers with all the ramifications thereof.
Nether IBM nor anyone else applied for or received any patents pertaining to the magnetic stripe card, the delta-distance barcodes or even the Uniform Product Code (UPC). IBM felt that with an open architecture it would enhance the growth of the media thereby resulting in more IBM computers and associated hardware being sold. As with all new technologies, the magnetic stripe card developed and produced by IBM IRD with one track of encoded data using the Delta Distance C Bar Code format was quickly obsolete. Because of the electronic ATM/reservation/check out/and access systems that were rapidly developing, the banks, airlines and other industries required more encoded data. A wider magnetic stripe enabling multiple tracks of encoding along with new encoding standards was required.
The first US Patents for the ATM were granted in 1972 and 1973 to Marior Karecki, George Chastain, Thomas Barnes and Thomas Barnes, George Chastain, Don Wetzel

Karecki, etal. Patent 3,685,690 August 22, 1972
Barnes, et al. Patent 3,761,682 September 25, 1973

Other groups within IBM and other companies continued on with expanding the work done by this small group of engineers at IBM IRD, however, the contributions that these IBM IRD engineers made to the development of the magnetic stripe card is analogous to the Wright Brother’s contribution to the airline industry of today.
Further developments and encoding standards
There were a number of steps required to convert the magnetic striped media into an industry acceptable device. These steps included: 1) Creating the international standards for stripe record content, including which information, in what format, and using which defining codes. 2) Field testing the proposed device and standards for market acceptance. 3) Developing the manufacturing steps needed to mass-produce the large number of cards required. 4) Adding stripe issue and acceptance capabilities to available equipment. These steps were initially managed by Jerome Svigals of the Advanced Systems Division of IBM, Los Gatos, California from 1966 to 1975.
In most magnetic stripe cards, the magnetic stripe is contained in a plastic-like film. The magnetic stripe is located 0.223 inches (5.66 mm) from the edge of the card, and is 0.375 inches (9.52 mm) wide. The magnetic stripe contains three tracks, each 0.110 inches (2.79 mm) wide. Tracks one and three are typically recorded at 210 bits per inch (8.27 bits per mm), while track two typically has a recording density of 75 bits per inch (2.95 bits per mm). Each track can either contain 7-bit alphanumeric characters, or 5-bit numeric characters. Track 1 standards were created by the airlines industry (IATA). Track 2 standards were created by the banking industry (ABA). Track 3 standards were created by the Thrift-Savings industry.
Magstripes following these specifications can typically be read by most point-of-sale hardware, which are simply general-purpose computers that can be programmed to perform specific tasks. Examples of cards adhering to these standards include ATM cards, bank cards (credit and debit cards including VISA and MasterCard), gift cards, loyalty cards, driver's licenses, telephone cards, membership cards, electronic benefit transfer cards (e.g. food stamps), and nearly any application in which value or secure information is not stored on the card itself. Many video game and amusement centers now use debit card systems based on magnetic stripe cards.
Magnetic stripe cloning can be detected by the implementation of magnetic card reader heads and firmware that can read a signature of magnetic noise permanently embedded in all magnetic stripes during the card production process. This signature can be used in conjunction with common two factor authentication schemes utilized in ATM, debit/retail point-of-sale and prepaid card applications.
Counterexamples of cards which intentionally ignore ISO standards include hotel key cards, most subway and bus cards, and some national prepaid calling cards (such as for the country of Cyprus) in which the balance is stored and maintained directly on the stripe and not retrieved from a remote database.
Magnetic stripe coercivity

Magstripes come in two main varieties: high-coercivity (HiCo) at 4000 Oe and low-coercivity (LoCo) at 300 Oe but it is not infrequent to have intermediate values at 2750 Oe. High-coercivity magstripes require higher amount of magnetic energy to encode, and therefore are harder to erase. HiCo stripes are appropriate for cards that are frequently used, such as a credit card. Low-coercivity magstripes require a lower amount of magnetic energy to record, and hence the card writers are much cheaper than machines which are capable of recording high-coercivity magstripes. However, LoCo cards are much easier to erase and have a shorter lifespan. A card reader can read either type of magstripe, and a high-coercivity card writer may write both high and low-coercivity cards (most have two settings, but writing a LoCo card in HiCo may sometimes work), while a low-coercivity card writer may write only low-coercivity cards.
In practical terms, usually low coercivity magnetic stripes are a light brown color, and high coercivity stripes are nearly black; exceptions include a proprietary silver-colored formulation on transparent American Express cards. High coercivity stripes are resistant to damage from most magnets likely to be owned by consumers. Low coercivity stripes are easily damaged by even a brief contact with a magnetic purse strap or fastener. Because of this, virtually all bank cards today are encoded on high coercivity stripes despite a slightly higher per-unit cost.
Magnetic stripe cards are used in very high volumes in the mass transit sector, replacing paper based tickets with either a directly applied magnetic slurry or hot foil stripe. Slurry applied stripes are generally less expensive to produce and are less resilient but are suitable for cards meant to be disposed after a few uses.
Financial cards

There are up to three tracks on magnetic cards known as tracks 1, 2, and 3. Track 3 is virtually unused by the major worldwide networks, and often isn't even physically present on the card by virtue of a narrower magnetic stripe. Point-of-sale card readers almost always read track 1, or track 2, and sometimes both, in case one track is unreadable. The minimum cardholder account information needed to complete a transaction is present on both tracks. Track 1 has a higher bit density (210 bits per inch vs. 75), is the only track that may contain alphabetic text, and hence is the only track that contains the cardholder's name.
Track 1 is written with code known as DEC SIXBIT plus odd parity. The information on track 1 on financial cards is contained in several formats: A, which is reserved for proprietary use of the card issuer, B, which is described below, C-M, which are reserved for use by ANSI Subcommittee X3B10 and N-Z, which are available for use by individual card issuers:
Track 1, Format B:
Start sentinel — one character (generally '%')
Format code="B" — one character (alpha only)
Primary account number (PAN) — up to 19 characters. Usually, but not always, matches the credit card number printed on the front of the card.
Field Separator — one character (generally '^')
Name — 2 to 26 characters
Field Separator — one character (generally '^')
Expiration date — four characters in the form YYMM.
Service code — three characters
Discretionary data — may include Pin Verification Key Indicator (PVKI, 1 character), PIN Verification Value (PVV, 4 characters), Card Verification Value or Card Verification Code (CVV or CVC, 3 characters)
End sentinel — one character (generally '?')
Longitudinal redundancy check (LRC) — it is one character and a validity character calculated from other data on the track.
Track 2: This format was developed by the banking industry (ABA). This track is written with a 5-bit scheme (4 data bits + 1 parity), which allows for sixteen possible characters, which are the numbers 0-9, plus the six characters  : ;  =  ? . The selection of six punctuation symbols may seem odd, but in fact the sixteen codes simply map to the ASCII range 0x30 through 0x3f, which defines ten digit characters plus those six symbols. The data format is as follows:
Start sentinel — one character (generally ';')
Primary account number (PAN) — up to 19 characters. Usually, but not always, matches the credit card number printed on the front of the card.
Separator — one char (generally '=')
Expiration date — four characters in the form YYMM.
Service code — three digits. The first digit specifies the interchange rules, the second specifies authorisation processing and the third specifies the range of services
Discretionary data — as in track one
End sentinel — one character (generally '?')
Longitudinal redundancy check (LRC) — it is one character and a validity character calculated from other data on the track. Most reader devices do not return this value when the card is swiped to the presentation layer, and use it only to verify the input internally to the reader.
Service code values common in financial cards:
First digit
1: International interchange OK
2: International interchange, use IC (chip) where feasible
5: National interchange only except under bilateral agreement
6: National interchange only except under bilateral agreement, use IC (chip) where feasible
7: No interchange except under bilateral agreement (closed loop)
9: Test
Second digit
0: Normal
2: Contact issuer via online means
4: Contact issuer via online means except under bilateral agreement
Third digit
0: No restrictions, PIN required
1: No restrictions
2: Goods and services only (no cash)
3: ATM only, PIN required
4: Cash only
5: Goods and services only (no cash), PIN required
6: No restrictions, use PIN where feasible
7: Goods and services only (no cash), use PIN where feasible
United States and Canada driver's licenses

Note: Each state has a different selection of information they encode, not all states are the same. Note: Some states, such as Texas, have laws restricting drivers licenses being swiped under certain circumstances.
Other card types
Smart cards are a newer generation of card that contain an integrated circuit. Some smart cards have metal contacts to electrically connect the card to the reader, and contactless cards use a magnetic field or radio frequency (RFID) for proximity reading.
Hybrid smart cards include a magnetic stripe in addition to the chip — this is most commonly found in a payment card, so that the cards are also compatible with payment terminals that do not include a smart card reader.
Cards with all three features: magnetic stripe, smart card chip, and RFID chip are also becoming common as more activities require the use of such cards.

ReferencesMi Minör is a Turkish play which premiered in 2012, said to be inspired by the Arab Spring. It is set in a fictional country, "Pinima", a country in which "despite being a democracy, everything is decided by the President," and the musical note Mi is banned. The play is significant for its integration of social media, with the audience encouraged to bring smart phones and follow an online version of the play carried out in real time alongside the stage production. Director Memet Ali Alabora described Pinima as "a sugar-coated democracy where everything is decided by the President. ... Everything is free in Pinima as long as the President approves." Mi Minör's digital versions operate on Twitter, Ustream, and via its own smart phone app.
In June 2010, during the 2013 protests in Turkey (which director Alabora vocally supported and which depended on social media), the newspaper Yeni Şafak claimed on its front page that the play was a rehearsal for an attempt to topple to government.
ReferencesThe Reddy kingdom (1325–1448 CE) was established in southern India by Prolaya Vema Reddi. The region that was ruled by the Reddi dynasty is now part of modern day coastal and central Andhra Pradesh. Prolaya Vema Reddi was part of the confederation that started a movement against the invading Turkic Muslim armies of the Delhi Sultanate in 1323 CE and succeeded in repulsing them from Warangal.

Origin
The first of the Reddi clans came into prominence during the Kakatiya and their own DurjayaKamma Musunuri kings period. The Reddi chiefs were appointed as generals and soldiers under the Kakatiyas. Reddis were among the feudatories of Kakatiya ruler Pratapa Rudra. During this time the Reddis carved out feudal principalities for themselves. The Reddi feudatories fought against the invading Muslim sultans and defended the region from coming under Muslim rule. Eventually, the Muslim army of the Delhi Sultanate invaded Warangal and captured Pratapa Rudra. In 1323 CE, after the death of Pratapa Rudra and the subsequent fall of the Kakatiya empire, the Reddi chiefs became independent. Prolaya Vema Reddi proclaimed independence and established the Reddi Kingdom in Addanki.
Extent of rule

They ruled coastal and central Andhra for over a hundred years from 1325 to 1448 CE. At its maximum extent, the Reddi kingdom stretched from cuttak,orissa to the north, Kanchi to the south and Srisailam to the west. The initial capital of the kingdom was Addanki. Later, it was moved to Kondavidu and subsequently to Rajahmundry. The Reddis were known for their fortifications. Two major hill forts, one at Kondapalli, 20 km north west of Vijayawada and another at Kondavidu about 30 km west of Guntur stand testimony to the fort building skill of the Reddi kings. The forts of Bellamkonda, Vinukonda and Nagarjunakonda in the Palnadu region were also part of the Reddi kingdom. The dynasty remained in power till the middle of the 15th century and was supplanted by the Gajapatis of Odisha, who gained control of coastal Andhra. The Gajapatis eventually lost control of coastal Andhra after Gajapati Prataprudra Deva was defeated by Krishna Deva Raya of Vijaynagar. The territories of the Reddi kingdom eventually came under the control of the Vijayanagara Empire.
Religion


The Reddi rulers played a prominent part in post-Kakatiyas of Telangana. The Kakatiya empire came to an end in 1323 CE after the Muslim army of the Delhi sultanate invaded Warangal and captured Kakatiya ruler Pratapa Rudra. Warangal fell to the Muslim invaders and Ulugh Khan commanded Warangal and Telangana. During this time of foreign invasion and chaos in Telugu country, seeds of revolt were sown by two patriotic souls, Annaya Mantri and Kolani Rudradeva. They united the Telugu nobles with the singular purpose of rescuing Telugu country from Muslim domination and re-establish Hindu Dharma. Musunuri Prolaya Nayaka, Prolaya Vema Reddi, Recharla Singama Nayaka, Koppula Prolaya Nayaka and Manchikonda Ganapatinayaka were the prominent nobles. Musunuri Prolaya Nayaka was the chosen leader of this confederation of Telugu nobles who united and vowed to put an end to Muslim rule. They succeeded in repulsing the Muslim forces from Warangal and then established independent Kingdoms of their own.
It was during this chaotic period in Andhra history that Prolaya Vema Reddi established the Reddi kingdom in 1325 CE as a bulwark of Hinduism against the Islamic invaders. The Reddi rulers patronised and protected Hinduism and its institutions. The Brahmins were given liberal grants by the Reddi kings and the agraharas of Brahmins were restored. Vedic studies were encouraged. The Hindu temples of Srisailam and Ahobilam were provided with more facilities. Prolaya Vema Reddi bestowed a number of agraharas on the Brahmins. He was revered by the title of Apratima-Bhudana-Parasurama. He commissioned major repairs to the Srisailam Mallikarjuna Swami temple, and had a flight of steps built from the Krishna river to the temple. The Narasimha Swamy temple at Ahobilam was built during his reign. He built 108 temples for Shiva.
Literature
Telugu literature blossomed during the period of stability under the Reddi kings. The Reddi kings also patronized Sanskrit, the sacred Hindu language. Several of the Reddi kings themselves were distinguished scholars and authors. Kumaragiri Reddi, Kataya Vema Reddi and Pedakomati Vema Reddi were the most outstanding among them. Errapragada (Errana), Srinatha and Potana were the remarkable poets of this period. Errapragada, the last of the Kavitraya (Trinity of Poets) was the court poet of Prolaya Vema Reddi. He completed the Telugu translation of the Mahabharata. He completed the rendition of the Aranya Parva of Mahabharata left incomplete by Nannaya Bhattu (Aadi Kavi who started the translation of Mahabharata into Telugu). He wrote Hari Vamsa and Narasimha Purana. Errana's translation of the Ramayana in Chapu form (a style of poetry) has been lost.
Srinatha was considered the most distinguished writer of the Reddi period. He was the court poet of Pedakomati Vema Reddi. He wrote 'Palnadu Viracharitra' in 'Dwipada' meter. This story chronicles the 12th century war between two branches of Kalachuri family that ruled from Gurazala and Macherla. This battle changed the course of Andhra history, with political control passing into Kakateeya hands. Other works of Srinatha, include 'Pandita-radhya Charita', 'Sivaratrimahatmya,' 'Haravilasa', 'Bhimakhanda' and 'Kasikhanda'.
Gona Buddha Reddi lived during the 13th century so actually belonged to the Kakatiya period. He is famous for his Ranganatha Ramayanam. His translation of the Ramayana was a pioneering work and is still used during puppet shows.
Administration
The administration was carried according to the "Dharmasutras". One sixth of agriculture surplus was levied as tax. Under the reign of Anavota Reddi custom duties and taxes on trade were lifted. As a result trade flourished. Sea trade was carried through the port Motupalli. Large number of merchants settled down near it. Celebrating 'Vasantotsavalu' was revived during the rule of Anavema Reddi. The Brahmins were given liberal grants by the Reddi kings. Caste system was observed. Heavy taxes by Racha Vema Reddi made him highly unpopular.

ReferencesWashington Initiative 1240 "concerns creation of a public charter school system" was an initiative that appeared on the Washington state general ballot in November 2012. Originally filed with the Washington Secretary of State on May 31, proponents and paid signature gatherers collected enough signatures to be certified for the ballot on July 25, making it one of the fastest initiatives ever to do so, at an estimated cost of more than $6 per signature. Proposed charter schools would receive public funding but not be governed by local school districts. An August 2012 financial impact study by the state Office of Financial Management estimated "an indeterminate, but non-zero, fiscal impact to local public school districts" and "known state agency implementation costs" of at least $3 million in the first five years. The initiative was approved by voters in November 2012.

Ballot measure title and summary
The full text of the measure is available online.
Language describing I-1240 was challenged in court. As described by the Secretary of State's office, I-1240 "would authorize up to forty publicly-funded charter schools open to all students, operated through approved, nonreligious, nonprofit organizations, with government oversight; and modify certain laws applicable to them as public schools."

This measure would allow a newly-created state commission or approved local school boards to authorize qualifying nonreligious, nonprofit organizations to operate public charter schools, limited to forty schools over five years. Public charter schools would receive standard per-student public school funding and be open to all students without tuition. Public charter schools would be subject to teacher certification requirements, government oversight, and performance reporting requirements, but exempt from certain state laws and school district policies.

Support and Opposition
Washington voters previously rejected charter school measures. Beginning with I-177 in 1996, then I-729 in 2000 and Referendum 55 in 2004. Each of these proposals was brought forward by a few wealthy individuals and actively opposed by public school teachers, administrators and parent groups. Republican gubernatorial candidate Rob McKenna supports the measure, with democratic opponent Jay Inslee opposed. As per RCW 42.17A on "campaign disclosure and contribution," the Washington state Public Disclosure Commission posts campaign information online, including committee and donor information for referenda and initiatives As of August, 2012, PDC records show proponents of I-1240 with a nearly 50:1 fundraising advantage.
Statements for and against each ballot measure are available online as part of the official online voter's guide.
Support
The registered sponsor for the initiative was the League of Education Voters. I-1240 campaign was funded partly by a "handful" of Puget Sound area billionaires, including Bill Gates, Paul Allen and the parents of Jeff Bezos.   Alice Walton was also among the top five contributors.  The measure was also endorsed by Stand for Children. 
Opposition
The League of Women Voters of Washington opposed the measure, as did the Washington Education Association and the Washington Association of School Administrators. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has been opposed to all charter schools since 2010, and, although the National Parent Teacher Association conditionally supports charter schools, the Washington State PTA opposed I-1240 for not meeting "criteria for local oversight."  A variety of Democratic organizations and officials oppose I-1240.

Darkholme is among the few Asian American men working in Western gay porn as a director and actor, and is of Vietnamese descent. Much of his work as a director and actor contains bondage and particularly shibari, the Japanese art of rope bondage, a specialty within BDSM cultures. Van Darkholme (sometimes misspelled as "Darkholm") is a screen name; his birth name has been kept private. His Japanese fans call him "Van Darkholme TDN"
Throughout the 1990s, Darkholme was a fashion and photographic model. It is notable that Van was filming normal movies at first, some of his appearances include minor character in Andy Lau's the Adventurers and Jackie Chan's Who am I?. Darkholme's book of bondage photography, Male Bondage, was published by Bruno Gmünder in June 2006. In 2008, The San Francisco-based BDSM studio Kink hired Darkholme, where he currently directs gay pornography with an emphasis on bondage and wrestling. Darkholme identifies as homosexual.

Peter López Santos (born September 23, 1981) is a Peruvian taekwondo fighter. He is most recognized for being a top international featherweight athlete for the Peruvian Taekwondo Team at present.
Biography
López was born in Irvine, California, in the United States, but aged five his family returned to live in Surquillo (Lima, Peru) for a few years.
It was in Peru that López started his first taekwondo class with his dad, who would later become his coach during the early years of his career as an athlete.
Eventually the family López returned to the U.S, where he began to compete very successfully, winning: 1998 Youth World Champion, Champion in the older category in 2001, bronze medal of the World Cup 2002, silver medal at the 2002 Pan American Championships and bronze medal at the 2003 World Championship, among others.
In 2004, the Peruvian Taekwondo Federation invited López to lead a training course. It was at this time that he decided to represent Peru. Despite this, the club Elite, Texas, continues to support him. "It's like my family," he once said.
According to the Peruvian Olympic Committee, of the 15 athletes who participated in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, López was the one that had the greatest chance of winning a medal in the 'feather' category (up to 68 kilos). López won his first two matches against Burak Hasan from Australia and Isah Adam Muhammad from Nigeria before losing the semifinal matches against the American Mark Lopez. He would then dispute the bronze medal match against Servet Tazegül from Turkey where he lost by one point.
In 2011, he competed at the 2011 Pan American Games where he would also represent Peru in the 68 kilos category. He did not advance from the quarterfinals.
Lopez represented Peru at the 2012 London Olympics.

ReferencesIn mathematics, a quasitoric manifold is a topological analogue of the nonsingular projective toric variety of algebraic geometry. A smooth -dimensional manifold is a quasitoric manifold if it admits a smooth, locally standard action of an -dimensional torus, with orbit space an -dimensional simple convex polytope.
Quasitoric manifolds were introduced in 1991 by M. Davis and T. Januszkiewicz, who called them "toric manifolds". However, the term "quasitoric manifold" was eventually adopted to avoid confusion with the class of compact smooth toric varieties, which are known to algebraic geometers as toric manifolds.
Quasitoric manifolds are studied in a variety of contexts in algebraic topology, such as complex cobordism theory, and the other oriented cohomology theories.

Definitions
Denote the -th subcircle of the -torus  by  so that . Then coordinate-wise multiplication of  on  is called the standard representation.
Given open sets  in  and  in , that are closed under the action of , a -action on  is defined to be locally isomorphic to the standard representation if , for all  in ,  in , where  is a homeomorphism , and  is an automorphism of .
Given a simple convex polytope  with  facets, a -manifold  is a quasitoric manifold over  if,
the -action is locally isomorphic to the standard representation,
there is a projection  that maps each -dimensional orbit to a point in the interior of an -dimensional face of , for   .
The definition implies that the fixed points of  under the -action are mapped to the vertices of  by , while points where the action is free project to the interior of the polytope.
The dicharacteristic function
A quasitoric manifold can be described in terms of a dicharacteristic function and an associated dicharacteristic matrix. In this setting it is useful to assume that the facets  of  are ordered so that the intersection  is a vertex  of , called the initial vertex.
A dicharacteristic function is a homomorphism , such that if  is a codimension- face of , then  is a monomorphism on restriction to the subtorus  in .
The restriction of λ to the subtorus  corresponding to the initial vertex  is an isomorphism, and so  can be taken to be a basis for the Lie algebra of . The epimorphism of Lie algebras associated to λ may be described as a linear transformation , represented by the  dicharacteristic matrix  given by



The th column of  is a primitive vector  in , called the facet vector. As each facet vector is primitive, whenever the facets  meet in a vertex, the corresponding columns  form a basis of , with determinant equal to . The isotropy subgroup associated to each facet  is described by



for some  in .
In their original treatment of quasitoric manifolds, Davis and Januskiewicz introduced the notion of a characteristic function that mapped each facet of the polytope to a vector determining the isotropy subgroup of the facet, but this is only defined up to sign. In more recent studies of quasitoric manifolds, this ambiguity has been removed by the introduction of the dicharacteristic function and its insistence that each circle  be oriented, forcing a choice of sign for each vector . The notion of the dicharacteristic function was originally introduced V. Buchstaber and N. Ray to enable the study of quasitoric manifolds in complex cobordism theory. This was further refined by introducing the ordering of the facets of the polytope to define the initial vertex, which eventually leads to the above neat representation of the dicharacteristic matrix  as , where  is the identity matrix and  is an  submatrix.
Relation to the moment-angle complex
The kernel  of the dicharacteristic function acts freely on the moment angle complex , and so defines a principal -bundle  over the resulting quotient space . This quotient space can be viewed as



where pairs ,  of  are identified if and only if  and  is in the image of  on restriction to the subtorus  that corresponds to the unique face  of  containing the point , for some .
It can be shown that any quasitoric manifold  over  is equivariently diffeomorphic to a quasitoric manifold of the form of the quotient space above.
Examples
The -dimensional complex projective space  is a quasitoric manifold over the -simplex . If  is embedded in  so that the origin is the initial vertex, a dicharacteristic function can be chosen so that the associated dicharacteristic matrix is



The moment angle complex  is the -sphere , the kernel  is the diagonal subgroup , so the quotient of  under the action of  is .
The Bott manifolds that form the stages in a Bott tower are quasitoric manifolds over -cubes. The -cube  is embedded in  so that the origin is the initial vertex, and a dicharacteristic function is chosen so that the associated dicharacteristic matrix  has  given by



for integers .
The moment angle complex  is a product of  copies of 3-sphere embedded in , the kernel  is given by

,

so that the quotient of  under the action of  is the -th stage of a Bott tower. The integer values  are the tensor powers of the line bundles whose product is used in the iterated sphere-bundle construction of the Bott tower.
The cohomology ring of a quasitoric manifold
Canonical complex line bundles  over  given by

,

can be associated with each facet  of , for , where  acts on , by the restriction of  to the -th subcircle of  embedded in . These bundles are known as the facial bundles associated to the quasitoric manifold. By the definition of , the preimage of a facet  is a -dimensional quasitoric facial submanifold  over , whose isotropy subgroup is the restriction of  on the subcircle  of . Restriction of  to  gives the normal 2-plane bundle of the embedding of  in .
Let  in  denote the first Chern class of . The integral cohomology ring  is generated by , for , subject to two sets of relations. The first are the relations generated by the Stanley–Reisner ideal of ; linear relations determined by the dicharacterstic function comprise the second set:

.

Therefore only  are required to generate  multiplicatively.
Comparison with toric manifolds
Any projective toric manifold is a quasitoric manifold, and in some cases non-projective toric manifolds are also quasitoric manifolds.
Not all quasitoric manifolds are toric manifolds. For example, the connected sum  can be constructed as a quasitoric manifold, but it is not a toric manifold.

The Creaser Hotel, also known as the Jane Cody Residence , is a hotel and residence in Republic, Washington and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The hotel was built in 1897 by Phil Creaser, who located the Republic and Jim Blaine mines. Located on the crest of Creaser Hill, this building is the oldest frame structure still in existence in Republic, and surpassed in age only by the Kaufman Cabin, built one year earlier in 1896. The building has shiplap siding and a hip roof porch with pierced barge boards and bracketed posts on two sides. When first constructed water was provided by a water tower and gravity feed water system, both of which have now been removed. The building was operated as a hotel until sometime in 1905-1909 by Phil Creaser, at which time it was sold to the George Moody Family. It has since served as a private residence.

R v Horncastle  Others [2009] UKSC 14 was a significant judgment of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom regarding hearsay evidence and the compatibility of UK hearsay law with the right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The case represents another stage in the judicial dialogue between the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and the higher courts of the United Kingdom about whether it is acceptable to base convictions "solely or to a decisive extent" on evidence made by a witness who is identified but does not appear in court (for example, in a witness statement made to the police).
A panel of 7 judges sat in the case, including the President of the Supreme Court, Lord Phillips, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge and the Master of the Rolls, Lord Neuberger. The court unanimously affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal and dismissed the appeals of several defendants who were convicted on the basis of statements of absent witnesses.
The case can be viewed as a direct response to the European Court of Human Rights ruling in Al-Khawaja v United Kingdom (2009) 1 EHRR 49  in which the facts were legally very similar. In this case the ECtHR ruled against the state and found that while it was justifiable to allow hearsay evidence in some circumstances, it was likely never permissible for a conviction to be based solely or decisively on such evidence. Al-Khawaja has been appealed by the United Kingdom and the decision by the Grand Chamber (a larger panel of judges which did not overturn the initial decision) is available. The Lords in Horncastle do not look favourably upon the decision of the Grand Chamber stating "that although the domestic court was required to take account of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights in applying principles which were clearly established, where, on rare occasions, the domestic court was concerned that the European court's decision insufficiently appreciated or accommodated particular aspects of the domestic process, it might decline to follow the decision".

Background
Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees a fair trial to anybody charged with a criminal offence. As a subset of this general right, accused persons are entitled to benefit from a number of "minimum rights", one of which under Article 6(3)(d) is the right to cross-examine prosecution witnesses.
Previous cases in the European Court of Human Rights such as Lucà v Italy and Kostovski v Netherlands concerned trials in which either the testimony of anonymous witnesses or witness statements made by witnesses who were not called in court were accepted as evidence. The European Court accepted that while allowing this sort of evidence did prima facie breach a defendants rights under Article 6(3)(d), this was acceptable so long as sufficient counterbalances were present. The court maintained the caveat that although this sort of evidence was normally acceptable, it was never appropriate for a conviction to be based solely or decisively on this sort of untested evidence.
In Al-Khawaja v United Kingdom (2009) 49 EHRR 1, two applications to the ECtHR were made by men who had been convicted on criminal charges on the basis of untested hearsay statements. In one case a defendant was convicted of indecent assault on the basis of the statement of a woman who had subsequently committed suicide, in the other a defendant was convicted of wounding with intent (contrary to section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861) on the basis of a statement made by the victim, who had been unwilling to testify in court. The ECtHR found that in both cases the state was in breach of Article 6 by allowing convictions to be based "solely or decisively" on hearsay evidence.
Facts
Two of the Appellants had been convicted of committing grievous bodily harm with intent. Their convictions were based "to a decisive extent" on a statement made by the victim of the alleged offence, who had later died (the cause of his death was "not attributable to the injuries" he suffered). The other appellants were convicted of kidnapping, in this case their conviction was found to have been based "to a decisive extent" on a statement made by the victim who had not attended the trial due to fear.
Under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, it was permissible for the trial judges in each case to allow this evidence to be presented in this way. The Act provided for a general presumption that hearsay evidence should not be allowed in criminal trials but this presumption could be defeated when witnesses were unavailable due to one of a number of prescribed reasons (including the witness having died before the trial under section 116(2)(a) or the witness being unavailable for trial due to fear under section 116(2)(e).
The Act also provided a number of safeguards and exceptions which allowed judges to exclude unsafe or unfair hearsay evidence, permitted opposing counsel additional grounds to attack the credibility of absent witnesses  and gave the judge a discretionary power to stop the case if the prosecution's case was based to any extent on hearsay evidence and was not convincing. The Act did not make any mention of the evidence of absent witnesses which was the "sole or decisive" basis of a conviction, (although this rule is one of the criteria which must be considered by a judge when determining if a witness should be allowed anonymity).
In the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) an augmented panel of five judges unanimously affirmed the convictions of the appellants, declining to follow the "sole or decisive" rule found in the ECtHR cases and expressing support for the code of statutory provisions on hearsay contained within sections 114 to 136 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Their reasons were often similar to those in the Supreme Court, and in his judgment Lord Phillips expressed approval of the Court of Appeal's reasoning and stated that the two rulings were best read as a whole.
Judgment
Arguments were made in the House of Lords between the 7 and 9 July 2009. Senior Counsel were Tim Owen QC and Shaun Smith QC for the two sets of appellants and David Perry QC for the Crown in response. An extended panel of 7 Justices heard the case, which is common practice when a case raises important human rights issues.
On 9 December 2009, the Court ruled unanimously in favour of the crown and dismissed the appeals. The Court's President Lord Phillips gave the leading judgment, with which the rest of the court agreed, although Lord Brown added some brief comments and Lord Mance prepared an annex detailing the history of similar cases in the ECtHR.
The court began by asserting that it was not bound by the ECtHR precedent. It confirmed that under section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 it was required to "take into account" Strasbourg cases and this meant that on rare occasions, they did not need to be followed.
Lord Phillips then set out his reasons for dismissing the appeal. His reasoning centred around the ECtHR's perceived failure to accommodate UK law, both in terms of a failure to appreciate the strengths of the common law tradition with regard to criminal evidence and those of the current law which "render the sole or decisive rule unnecessary".
The court felt that it was significant that UK law had long incorporated safeguards against untested, hearsay evidence and this had ensured that the rights encompassed by article 6(3)(d) had long been protected by English law. The system in the UK was compared to the that of France at the time of the Convention's creation. In this system, and other continental criminal procedures, a formal inquisitorial process was conducted by a judge before the trial itself, which lacked, according to Lord Phillips, many of the constituent rights attached to the concept of a fair trial, for example a lack of rules of evidence and the interrogation of witnesses in the absence of the defendant. It was suggested that the purpose of the rights codified in article 6 was to prevent this type of conduct, and was not designed to have a major effect on common law systems.
The current statutory regime enacted by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 was also praised as a "crafted code" which ensured that hearsay evidence was properly admitted. It was noted that the current system was heavily influenced by the Law Commission and by consultation with experts. It was suggested that to introduce the "sole or decisive rule" without discussion or consideration would damage this code.
The court also noted that the rule would create practical difficulties in the criminal system, and that it was virtually always the case that UK law did exclude evidence that fell within the "sole or decisive rule".
Another observation made was that the rule is paradoxical; it results in spurious or weak hearsay evidence which would not result in a conviction alone being admitted, while stronger, damning evidence which is likely to achieve a conviction even in the absence of further evidence being excluded. It was suggested that this approach did not make sense, and that good systems tend to exclude weak, not strong evidence.
